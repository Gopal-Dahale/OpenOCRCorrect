PREFACE 

When I first came to Oxford in the autumn of 1916, I undertook, 

on the suggestion of Professor A. A. Maedonell, to collate the hitherto 

unutilized Nirulda Manuscripts, contained in the Max Miiller Memorial 

and the Chandra Shum Shere Collections, and to see if some new light 

i^ould be thrown on the text of the Nirukta. A careful examination of the 

D::materials at my disposal has led me to the conclusion that the text of 

|2|the Nirukta has been gradually expanded by the addition of short passages, 

chiefly in the etymological explanations which easily lent themselves to 

such interpolations. At present the history of this gradual expansion 

^can be traced only down to the thirteenth century a.d. There is a lack 

2 of reliable evidence going further. But I have reasons to suspect that even 

-« up to the thirteenth century, the text of the NiTulda has not been handed 

.—I 

^down with a uniform and unbroken tradition. A few remarks of Durga 

/^scattered here and there in his commentary open up the possibility that 

the interpolators were already busy with their nefarious work. There 

is no doubt that the text had already been tampered with. Thus one 

should be cautious in making Yaska responsible for many passages, and the 

u; numerous absurd derivations contained therein, now commonly attributed 

^to him. All such passages have been pointed out in my edition of the 

^jtext, which sets forth as clearly as possible the history of the gradual 

.expansion by means of square brackets and foot-notes. 

• I have also produced, for the first time, a complete English translation 

of the whole of the Nirukta. I have added numerous exegetical and 

critical notes with a view to extract as much information as possible 

from Yaska. And in order to make my work further useful, I have 

also prepared the following Indexes and Appendices: (1) An Index to 

the words of the Nighaiitu with meanings;] (2) An Index to the words of 

the Quoted Passages occurring in the Nii^hta with meanings ; (3) an Index 

A 2 






2 PREFACE 

Verborum to the Nirukta minus the Quoted Passages with meanings ; 

(4) An alphabetical list of the Quotations occurring in the Nirukta; 

(5) An alphabetical list of the Untraced Quotations occurring in the 
Niviikta ; (6) A list of Vedic Quotations arranged in the order of the 
Samhitds ; (7) A list of the Authorities mentioned by Yaska ; (8) A list 
of Stories related by Yaska ; (9) The Relation of the Nirukta to other 
texts, i.e. a collection of parallel passages from the BrdhmaTias, Prdti- 
sdkhyas, Mahdbhdsya, &c. ; (10) An alphabetical list of the etymologies 
to be found in the NiTukta; (11) A list of the Nirukta passages quoted 
by Saj^ana. The whole work being embodied in the form of a dissertation 
was presented to, and accepted by, the University of Oxford, for the 
degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Notwithstanding the Statt. Tit. VI, 
Sec. V, § 5. (8), which requires an Advanced Student to publish his thesis 
in extenso before supplicating for the said degree, the Committee for 
Advanced Studies very kindly permitted me — taking into consideration 
the very high cost of printing at present — to publish the Introduction 
alone. I think I need make no apology for bringing out this part only 
at present, in the hope that the rest will follow in course of time. 

If my labours have borne any fruit, it is simply due to the guidance 
which I have received in the course of my work, and which it is my very 
pleasant duty to acknowledge. 

I owe a great debt of gratitude to Professor A. A. Macdonell. The 
inception of this study is, as I have already mentioned, due to his 
suggestion. The whole work was done under his supervision. His guidance 
and encouragement have been of invaluable help to me. And through his 
recommendation the Administrators to the Max Miiller Memorial Fund have 
voted a sum of £50 for the publication of my dissertation — my thanks to 
them for this generous help. I am much indebted to Dr. F. W. Thomas^ 
Librarian, India Office, and to Dr. J. Morison, Librarian, Indian Institute, 
Oxford, for granting me facilities in the use of books, and for their 
readiness to help me in every way whenever I liad the occasion to seek 
their advice. I desire to put on record my special thanks to Mr. Madan, 
ex-Librarian of the Bodleian, for permission to work on valuable manu- 
scripts during the dark days of air-raids, when the manuscripts had been 
carefully stored away. Professor A. B. Keith has placed me under great 



PREFACE 3 

obligation by giving me his valuable opinion on many difficult points. 
Dr. T. W. Arnold, C.I.E., Educational Adviser to the Secretary of State 
for India, has taken a good deal of interest in my work and has supported 
me in almost every obstacle to the completion of my studies. 

It lias been my privilege to interpret an ancient Indian author, who, 
as far as Etymology and Semantics are concerned, is far in advance of 
the greatest of ancient Greek writers like Plato and Aristotle, and if he 
comes to be better appreciated, my labour will be amply repaid.

a. Detailed Description of the Manuscripts. 

M 1. — This is a neatly- written manuscript in Devandgarl characters on 
paper. It originally consisted of 13 leaves, but the first two are missing. 
The accent has been marked in yellow ink. The text is not bounded on 
either side by double lines. 

The size of the paper is 91'' x 3|". 

The number of lines on each page varies from 9 to 10. The date given 
on f. 14 r. as >S'a/c. 1455, is not reliable, and has obviously been added at 
a later period by a different hand, as the evidence of the writing indicates. 
The manuscript is well preserved, but neither its general appearance nor 
the condition and the colour of its paper, nor its spelling lend the least 
support to the date given above. It is on the whole accurate. It belongs 
to the longer recension. The scribe seems to have been a devotee of Krsna, 
for he saj'-s : ^ » «*u I M^T^- Neither the name of the scribe, nor of the 
owner, nor of the place of its origin, is known. 

M 2. — This is perhaps the oldest of all the manuscripts of the Nighantii. 
It is written in Devaadgarl characters on paper, but is not well preserved. 
In many places it suffers from illegibility, partly caused by the smudging 
of the ink. 

It begins : ^ ^^mt I^ITT^ II ^ II ^RI f^^t 3m^rrf^ . . • , &c. It gives 
the kiiksd Gatustaya in 26 leaves. The ditlerent treatises are not bodily

separated from each other, all the four, i. e. Siksd, Jyotisa, Chandas and 
JVighantu being written continuously without a break. The end of each 
is found on f. 4 r., f. 7 v., f. 12 r., and f. 24 v. respectively. The accent is 
not marked. The text is bounded on each side by double black lines. 

The size of the paper is 9|'' x 4|''. 

The number of lines on each page varies from 10-13. 

It has preserved the archaic spelling in many cases, especially in the 

case of W ; ^T^'T* is written T«fi1"'C^T^* and r^T^^ETTW^ as TrftT^^J on 
f. 22 V. Ff. 15-26 are slightly worm-eaten. It was copied in the month 
of Phdlguna, Samvat 1778, by a scribe named Sivananda. It belongs to 
the shorter recension. 

M 3. — This is a paper manuscript, neatly written in Devandgarl 
characters. In this manuscript also the Siksd, Jyotisa, Chandas, and 
Nighantu are written without a break between them. The accent in the 
Nighantu is not marked. The size of the paper is 9'' x 4", and the 
number of lines on each page is 7. The text is bounded on each side by 
double red lines. The name of the owner is Asarama Kedaresvara, son of 
Sri Nandarama. It was copied for private study at Benares. The date given 
is Samvat 1801: {sic) ^^?[^ «^cos TTf^TfTT ^^Wn% ^JW^^ ^=^?f^ ^¥^1^

It belongs to the shorter recension. 

M 4. — This contains the Siksd, &c., without a break between them, and 
gives, in 23 leaves, the Siksd, Jyotisa, Chandas, and Nighantu, which end on 
f. 5 v., f. 8 r., f. 13 r., and f. 23 v. respectively. The five adhdyds of the 
Nighantu end on f. 15 v., f. 18 v., f. 21 r., f. 22 v., f. 23 v. respectively. It 
begins : ^ ^1%^^ ^W. II ^ l^T^ 'W: II #< ^^ fil^ TT^^lf^T, &c. It 
ends : Xf^ %^T^ iif^^iff^T^: ^*ITH- II 

The size of paper is 8f " x 3f ; the number of lines on each page is 
8. The text is bounded on either side by double red lines. The accent is 
marked in the Nighantu with red ink. No date is given, nor the name 
of the scribe, nor the place. 

It belongs to the longer recension. 

C 1. — It consists of three different manuscripts. The first manuscript, 
w hich gives the Nighantu in full, seems to be a fragment, for the first folio 
is numbered 10. It appears that originally it gave the Siksd Catustaya^ 



DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPTS 7 

and that now the Nighantu alone survives. It begins on f. 10 r., and ends 
on f. 22 r. The text is bounded on each side by <louble red lines. The 
accent is marked. The size of the paper is 9" x 4|"; the number of lines 
is 11. It ends: [sic) T^ f^T^ q^jftWR: II ^ fft^Ht%^TT^I!r^ II 

sft ^T TT^^ II 

The date &ak. 1875, and the name of the then owner, Gopala Ananda 
Sarasvati, are added in a different, probably later, hand. It belongs to the 
longer recension. 

C 2. — Is the first of five difierent manuscripts bound in one volume 
[e. 62]. It contains the Nighantu in 17 leaves, marking the accent with 
red ink in the first adhydya only. 

It begins : || ^ tt^IH^ 'T^: II f f^: ^ II It ends : (sic) ?frf f^TETZ 
tN^ft^T^: II ^^TF' II Neither the date nor the name of the scribe is 
given. 

The size of the paper is 8|" x 3i". The number of lines on each page 
is 7. Ff. 15, 16, 17 are slightly worm-eaten. 

It is written in Devanagan characters on paper, and is fairly accurate. 
It belongs to the longer recension. 

C3-C4. — Are contained in the same volume, each being a Siksd 
Catudaya, of which the Mgharitu forms a part. The text of each of these 
^iJcsd Cutustaya is written continuously, and is bounded by double red 
lines. The size of the paper is 8i'' x 4, and the number of lines on each 
page is 10. The first two sections of the first adhydya are missing in the 
first manuscript. The other manuscript is dated Samvat, 1852. 

Both are written in Devandgarl characters and represent the longer 
recension. 

The other manuscripts are a ^iksd attributed to Panini, and a iSiksd 
attributed to Yajiiavalkya. The latter begins : (t^ie) ^ ^ 1%WT^ 'W* 

cT^^ rlrl ^^ni- ^f^^lf^ ^^ ^T^%^ "^ , &c. It ends: ff^ #

Another manuscript bound in the same volume gives in seven leaves 
the ^iksd of the Sdma Veda, attributed to Lomasa. It begins: # •W: 
^T*T%^^. It has preserved some old spellings ; for instance, it writes 
^^ as T^^. 

The last manuscript gives the GIui ndomafijari in 5 leaves. It begins : (sir)

S 4.— This manuscript contains five works. The first four consist of 
the Siksd Catustaya, of which the first three works are probably written 
by the same scribe. The first part gives the Siksd in 6 leaves, the second the 
Jyotisa in 4, the third the Chandas in 7 leaves, the fourth the Nighantii} 
The first and third were copied in &aka 1665, and the fourth in &aka 1660. 
All these four parts are complete in themselves individually, each being 
separately numbered. The name of their former owner is Bhatta Jayana- 
rayana of Themti. 

The Nighardu consists of 9 leaves. The text is bounded on each side 
by a pair of double red lines. It is a neatly-written manuscript, The 
accent is marked with red ink. The size of the paper is 9|'' x 3|''. For 
further details see Catalogus Codd. MSS. Bib. Bodl., by Winternitz and 
Keith, vol. ii, p. 105. 

The manuscript belongs t© the longer recension, and does not seem to 
have been used by Roth. 

W 1. — This contains two difierent manuscripts. The first is Veddrtha- 
dipikd, a commentary on the Sarvdnukraraanl by Sadgurusisya. 

The second is the Nighantu. It begins on f. 1 v., and ends on f. 10 r. 
It is without accent, quite modern, and full of mistakes. It is Roth's F. 
It belongs to the shorter recension. 

For further details, see Catalogus Codd. MSS, Bib. Bodl., by Winternitz 
and Keith, vol. ii, p. 104. 

W 2. — This manuscript contains three different works. 

I. The first work is the Siksd Catustaya. It is a continuously-written 
manuscript, the four parts ending on f. 3 v., f. 6 v., f. 11 v., and f. 23 
respectively. The Nighantu is given without accent. It is Roth's C, and 
belongs to the shorter recension. For further details see Catalogus Codd. 
MSS. Bib. Bodl, vol. ii, p. 104. 

W 3. II. This is the second manuscript bound in the volume just 
mentioned. It gives the Nighantu in 24 leaves. It is without accent. 
The name of the scribe, partially obliterated by yellow pigment, is the 
following : ^^nTT^TW^fTf^^n^W f^f^rT II TI^T^^^'^'l II ^ft^^TTT^^l II 

It is Roth's D, and belongs to the shorter recension. 

III. The third manuscript is the Anuydkanukrainani. 

W4. — This manuscript contains two different works. The first is the 
Siksd Catustaya. Its first three parts are written continuously. The 

* The fifth is the UttarasaUcam of the Nirukta.

Mghantii is separated from the rest. It ends on f. 16, which gives a list 
of the total number of words and Khandas for each adhydya as follows : — 
Khanda words 
1st 17 412 4th 3 279 

2nd 22 516 5th 6 151 

3rd 30 410 

It is Roth's E, and belongs to the longer recension. 
To these manuscripts, which I have directly collated myself, may be 
added the A and B which were used by Roth (not directly collated by me), 
besides C.D.E.F = W 1, W2, W3, W4, and br, ^, Ji, ^, ^, and ^ used 
by Samasrami, in his edition, published in the Bib. Ind. 

b. Two recensions. 
The manuscripts fall into two distinct groups : M 2, M 3, W 1. W 2, W 3 
and 31 form one family group, and M 1, M4, C 1, C 2, C 3, C4, S. W 4 ; 
A, B, E; m, ^, ^, ^, and '^ the other. The former may be called the 
shorter recension, the latter the longer. The chief reason for calling the 
former group the shorter recension is that at the end of every section the 
explanation is more concise than in the other. The latter not only gives 
an extended explanation at the end of every section, but also adds the 
number of the words enumerated in the section. Besides, at the end of 
every chapter, it gives a summary of the sections by quoting the first word 
of every section, and adds the number of the sections in the chapter. In 
many sections the shorter recension gives fewer words. It is difficult to 
decide which of these two represents the original. But as far as the 
longer explanation at the end of every section is concerned, it is quite 
obvious that it is a later addition. The evidence of the manuscripts shows 
that this addition was gradual. For instance, let us take the first section 
of the first chapter. All the manuscripts of the shorter recension agree in 
giving the text as follows: ^ft^f^T ^f^J^TT:. Manuscript W2 gives the 
number of the section only, i.e. II «! 11, and throughout it follows tliis method, 
which seems to have been the original one. Gradually a change was 
introduced : along with the number of the section, the number of the words 
in the section was added, and a numerical figure placed immediately before 
the number of the section, as the evidence of manuscripts M 2 and W 3 
indicates, in the first section of the first chapter, II ^<^ II is placed before 
II °i II i- e. ^%f7I gf^^rr: ll ^<=l ll ^ ll In this connexion it is interesting to 
note that manuscripts W 1 and M 3 at first agree with W 2, but gradually 
come round to the side of M 2 and W 3. The next stage of development is 
marked by the incorporation of the numerical word in substitution for the 



10 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIGHANTU 

figure in the body of the explanation, as II 3ft"%^^f^irf?[: gf^3IT: II. This 
is most clearly seen in the sections containing verbs, for instance, in sec. 16 
of the first chapter, all the stages appear very clearly : 
«. ^f^ ^^f?iqiHTX!r: in^ II W 1, W 2. 

b. „ „ in<^ll=l^ll M2, M3, W3. 

c. ^^Tf^^^T^IT ^^f^^^W^ in^ II Manuscripts of longer recension. 
From the verbs the process was extended by analogy to nouns, perhaps 

in imitation of Yaska's own words or for the sake of parallelism, 
•TTT^nsiTf'T was also introduced. Last of all came the summary and the 
statement of the sections in every chapter. 

Yaska's description of the NigJiantu I Saindmndyah Smndmndtah I 8a 
vydkhydtavyah l N. I. 1. — and taking into consideration the fact that in 
some cases, like that of Nighantu II. 6, 8, 11, &c., his only explanation is 
that a particular word has so many synonyms — suits the shorter recension 
better, for in the case of the longer recension such an explanation is super- 
fluous. Nighmdu, II. 11, the shorter recension reads ^Iv^^fTT l^t, while 
the longer has: ITli'^fTT ^^ ^•TTTlf'T, and Yaska's only explanation 
(N. 3. 9) is: nt^TTTJ^Tt^^Tt^ ^^- To call this the explanation of the 
longer recension is absurd, while in the case of the shorter recension it may 
be accepted as an explanation to a certain extent. 

c. Devaraja and his commentary. 
Devarajayajvan explains every single word of the Nighantu ; his com- 
mentary therefore is valuable, for it shows the state of the Nighantu in his 
day. Moreover, in the introduction to his Commentary, he gives a general 
description of the many manuscripts of the Nighantw known to him. He 
says : ^ =^ ^^^"^'^ %^^TTHT^Tf^^: sjrrf^f^?q^T5?Tf^^T52IT€^ I "^Sf^ =^ 

He has attempted to supply a critical edition, for he says that Yaska 
explained 150 words of the Naighaiituka Kdnda, and Skandasvami, in 
his commentary on Yaska, added some more, bringing the total to 200, so 
the evidence of Yaska and Skandasvami was very valuable for these 200 
words. About the r(;st he says : '^^^i ^ ^^T«TT^WT^ ^% ^WT'^T^T- 



DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUSCRIPTS 11 

Devaraja has frequently given the readings of former commentators 
like Skandasvami, Bhatta Bhaskarami^ra, and Madhava, when he diffei'ed 
from them. His commentary has therefore the value of a collation of 
a number of manuscripts, brought as he says from various parts of the 
country, and also of the collation of former conmientaries. I have care- 
fully examined it and noted all the differences, as the foot-notes to the text 
will show. 

d. Both's edition of the Nighantu. 

Roth examined the commentary of Devaraja, but the manuscripts which 
he used were probably defective, so that his results are unsatisfactory. 
Often he attributes readings to Devaraja which are not to be found in the 
published text of that commentator; for instance (I. 11) the reading ^ 
is attributed to Devaraja, who actually reads ^: ; he also passes over 
variants given by Devaraja. Devaraja gives •!«n as a variant for •T^, 
which Roth does not mention. Similarly Devaraja gives g^ (I. 12) as a 
difi'erent reading, which Roth again does not notice. Devaraja gives TCm 
for V[^', , which Roth ignores. Other cases are : 

I. 14. Roth attributes ^If^: to Dev., who reads ^TofT*, and gives T(^: 
as a variant. 

I. 13. Dev. gives -^diq^: for ^^: as the reading of Madhava, unnoticed 

by Roth. 
I. 13. Dev. gives ^^(€f: for tsqnzi: as another reading, unnoticed by Roth. 
I. 14. Roth attributes ^^^c|f{: to Dev., whose actual reading is -^l^^c^^j: 

I. 15. Dev. reads ^3^^: for "^^MJ and gives ^(4^: as the reading of Skan- 
dasvami, unnoticed by Roth. 

I. 16. Dev. gives HTiT^f^ as another reading for ^^nj^lfTT unnoticed by 

Roth. 

II. 1. Dev. gives ^in^Pl^ as the reading of Madhava for ^sfRt, Roth does 

not notice it. 
II. 5. Dev. gives '^^^cj: as a different reading for "^^t, Roth does not 

notice it. 
II. 7. Dev. gives Jf^l as the reading of Skandasvami also, but he further 

gives ^(m as a variant. Roth does not notice it. 
II. 7. Dev. gi es ^: as a variant for ^^: , Roth does not notice it. 

It is unnecessary to multiply instances, for all such cases can be easily 
found in my foot-notes to the text of the Nighantu. 



12 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIGHANTU 

Roth does not give any various readings for the fourth chapter of the 
Nighantu, although the evidence of the manuscripts as shown in this 
edition proves that there are several such variants. 

There are a few inaccuracies of accent, for instance in III. 13. 
'^rf^ •! ^ is accented in manuscripts, but not so in Roth's edition. 

There is, however, a serious omission in IV. 2. ^T^TW« has been omitted 
between "^SI^^TI!!! and wfTH* • That the omission is an oversight appears 
from the fact that though this section is stated to contain 84 words, Roth's 
edition has only 83. Yaska explains every word of the fourth and fifth 
chapters of the Nighantu. His evidence is therefore particularly valuable 
for a critical edition of the fourth and fifth chapters. He gives ^^^T'lTt 
in its proper place and explains it. Both the recensions agree in reading 
f^T^: between "^^^I!!: and wfTfl^ and the testimony of Devaraja and 
Yaska supports this reading The omission ^ in Roth's edition is thus 
evidently due to an oversight. 

The evidence of Yaska on the fourth and fifth chapters of the Nighantu 
indicates that he follows the longer recension. Thus in IV. 1 the shorter 
recension gives ^f^I, but Yaska reads ?;f^l!J, which is also the reading of 
the longer recension. Again ^ ^, which is omitted by the shorter recension, 
is explained by Yaska. In IV. 2 ^?Tt is omitted by the shorter recension, but 
not by Yaska. Devaraja has also followed the longer recension, and this 
choice seems to be followed by a long line of commentators, and is also, as 
Devaraja says, supported by an unbroken tradition in his own family. The 
shorter recension has undoubtedly preserved the original form of the text, 
at least towards the end of the sections, but the weighty testimony of 
Yaska is against it. I have therefore given the text and the order in 
which the words occur in accordance with the longer recension, though at 
the end of every section I have placed side by side the text of both 
recensions. 

e. Bib. Ind. edition of the Nighantu. 

Samasrami's edition of the Nighantu is useful, for besides publishing 
the commentary of Devaraja Yajvan it supplies a much larger number of 
various readings than Roth. But it suffers from the one defect of present- 
ing only Devaraja's reading of the text of the Nighantu. The commentary 
of Devaraja, hoM^ever valuable as giving the various readings of the 
manuscripts of his time, cannot be made the sole basis of an edition of 
the Nighantu. Moreover, occasionally the text in this edition contains 
words which are not justified either by the evidence of the manuscripts of 
^ This was admitted, and later on rectified by Roth himself. 



THE TITLE OF THE WORK 13 

both recensions, or even by tliat of* Devaraja himself. For instance, on 
p. 236, appears the word ^^Frf?T, which does not exist anywliere ; again, on 
p. 257, we find ^f^f^fT^ instead of tlie correct form ^H 1 4)1^7!. Sama^- 
rami seems to have used six manuscripts, from which he gives a number 
of various readings in foot-notes, but in the constitution of the text he has 
consistently followed Devaraja. Hence it is not a critical edition, from the 
point of view of constituting an independent text of the Nighantu based on 
manuscript evidence. 

/. The title of the work. 

Sayanacarya in the Rgvedabhasyabhilmild has given the title of 
Niruhiam to this list of words. He says: "^R^^^^ f'Hi^'^tT^T H(^<3!TH 

^R^ frf^^im: I »fr: I Tin I ^m I wr I ^T I ^^^t ?7^T^ ^^^: i ^rf^: i 

^^xir^ \W\7Sl fTJT'fft ^: ^^^t ^WT^-R?: ^WT'TTrf^f^ ^T# q^T^T^^- 

VT^ iTTT^^ ^ f^?i% I fT^f^^w f^^Ti^^ .... irgrtzrr^r^ ^rni:^- 

Madhusudanasvami, the author of the Pradhdnahheda has also given 
the title of Niruktam to this list of words. Similarly Samasrami follows 
Sayana in calling the work Niruktam, although he adds in brackets 
(Nighantu). Sayana is evidently wrong in giving the title of Niruktam 
to the Samdmndya, for Yaska distinctly states that it is called Nighantu. 
Samdmndyah samdmndtah .... tarn imam SaTndmndyam Nighantava 
itydcaksate i (N. I. 1). The list of words can only be called Nighantu, and 
it is wrong to call it Nvniktam; the term Nirukta can be applied only 
when some etymological explanations are given. Moreover, all the manu- 
scripts call it Nighantu. 

g. The division of the Nighantu. 

The Nighantu contains five chapters, the first three are called the 
Naighantuka Kdnda, the fourth the Naigama Kdnda, and the fifth the 
Daivata Kdnda. In other words it may be said that 

the Naighantuka Kdnda deals with synonyms; 

the Naigama Kdnda deals with homonyms; 

the Daivata Kdnda deals with deities. 
There is some sort of a principle discernible in the arrangement of the 
synonyms in the first three chapters. The first chapter deals with phj'sical 
things like earth, air, water, and objects of nature like cloud, dawn, day 
and night, kc. The second chapter deals with man, his limbs, like arm, 
finger, objects and qualities associated with man, such as wealth, prosperity, 
anger, battle, &c. 



14 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIGHANTU 

The third chapter deals with abstract qualities such as heaviness, 
lightness, &c. The arrangement, of course, is not scientific, nor, in many- 
cases, even systematic, but it shows at least an attempt to group the 
words methodically. The compilation of the Nighantu is the earliest 
known attempt in lexicography. In India it marks the beginning of the 
Kokt literature, and later Kosds have sometimes been called Nighantavas. 
The Nighantu contains only a small number of the words of the Rgveda, 
and as it does not contain any explanations of the words collected, in 
Sanskrit or any other language, the modern term ' dictionary ' cannot be 
apphed to it, although the Koms can be so called. It should rather be 
called a vocabulary, which is a book ' containing a collection of words of 
a language, dialect, or subject ' — when ' the words are few in number, being 
only a small part of those belonging to the subject, or when they are given 
without explanation, or some only are explained, or explanations are 
partial '. 

h. The author of the Nighantu. 

Nothing definite is known of the author of the Nighantu. There is 
a vague reference to the time of its compilation in the Nirukta I. 20, 
which attributes the compilation of the Nighantu along with other 
Veddfigas to a later generation of the sages who had no direct perception 
of dharina (truth). 

The following two verses occur in the Moksa parvan of the Mahd- 
hhdmta, chapter 342. 86, 87 : 

f ft ff ^^W[^ V^T: '^Trfr ^1%^ JTTTfT I 

rT^Tf f TRifi inf ^fii^^t ^rf TT^mf?T: ii 

Some conclude from the second verse that Ka^yapa,^ the Prajapati, is 
the author of the Nighantu, for the word vrmkapi occurs in the Nighantu. 
It is not safe to build any argument upon such evidence, for supposing that 
Ka^yapa did invent the word vrmkapi he would be the last person to put 
his own word in a list of difficult words like those of the Nigho iitu. The 
Nighantu is probably not the production of a single individual, but the 
result of the united efforts of a whole generation, or perhaps of several 
generations. 

' The theory of Ka&yapa's authorship is indeed absurd, and hardly deserves any mention, 
but as many people in India believe in it, and seriously put it forward, I thought it necessary 
to make a passing reference to it. 



EAKLIER EDITIONS OF THE NIRUKTA 15 

THE NIHUKTA 

a. Earlier editions of the Nirukta. 

The editio princeps of the Niruhta was brought out by Rudolph Roth, 
and published at Gottingen in 1852. Sanskrit scholarship in Europe was 
then in its infancy. The bulk of the Vedic literature was as yet acces- 
sible in manuscripts only. Even the text of the R(jveda in print was not 
available, Max Miiller having given to the world the first two volumes 
only of his edition of the Rcjveda with Sayana's connnentary.^ Guides to 
Vedic studies which are now indispensable, such as Prof. Macdonell's Vedic 
Granwuir, and books of reference like Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance, did 
not exist at that time. There was not even a good Vedic dictionary. 
Takino- these facts into consideration, Roth's achievement was remarkable. 
He was the first to observe that the text of the XiniJda has been handed 
down in two recensions, a shorter and a longer one, and to prepare a critical 
edition of the same based on the manuscript material to which he then had 
access. It must be admitted that as far as the text of the Xirukta is con- 
cerned Roth's work has not been superseded so far, and this fact alone is 
very creditable to the author of a work published nearly 70 years ago, 
and speaks highly of the critical judgement exercised by him in the 
constitution of the text. 

But it is obvious that a work produced under such circumstances and 
about three-quarters of a century ago shows certain defects and limitations. 
First of all, the materials at his disposal were scantj^ For instance, he 
seems to have consulted only one manuscript of Durga's commentary, i.e. 
MS. Mill 142,^ by no means an accurate manuscript, and Roth's incorrect 
quotations from Durga's commentary, which I have pointed out in my 
notes, are perhaps due to the errors of this manuscript. Hence he could 
not have found it a very reliable guide. Secondly, many of the then pre- 
vailing methods of indicating references are now obsolete, as, for instance, 
Roth's division of the Rgveda into Manclala, anuvdka, &c., which has 
curtailed, to some extent, the usefulness of his Nachtveisimg. pp. 217-28. 
He gives a list of various readings at the end of the first and the second 
part of the Nirulda, but does not specify that such and such a variant is 
to be found in such and such a manuscript, a very unsatislactory method of 
procedure, which no modern editor would follow. Further, Roth has 
adopted the text of the longer recension in his edition, but he does not 

* Professor J. Wackernagel has been kind enough to write to me from Bale that as Roth's 
Nirukta first began to be printed in 1847, he could not therefore have made use of Max Miiller's 
edition of the Bgreda, the preface to the first volume of which is dated Oct. 1849. 

' Described by Keith in the Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, 
vol. ii, p. 108. 



16 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

show auy reason for this preference. As proved by me elsewhere, the 
longer recension does not represent the original text of the Kiruhta. 
Again, he divided the 'pariiista into two chapters, the 13th and the 14th, 
a division not supported by the evidence of older manuscripts, which makes 
the whole of the imrisiiita to consist of one chapter (the 13th) only. Roth 
is also wrong in using the term Naigama Kdndam as applicable to the first 
three chapters of the Nirukta, the right term being Naighantuka Kdndam. 
Further, there are some inaccuracies in the text of the Kirulda itself, which 
I have pointed out in my notes. Again, there is the inexplicable inconsis- 
tency in using large type for printing some Vedic quotations, and small 
type for others, even when they are of the same length, and are cited from 
the same Veda. For instance, the passage ^iIm^ •!: TTf^ '^W\ 'iff ' is 
printed in large type and is accented, whilst the immediately following 
passage '^ifl^ f^^^tefiir<^'^ is printed in small type, and is not accented, 
although both quotations are from the Rgveda. Other examples are : 
^rqm % ^TT ^^ TT *f ^^'N' 'T'^I^TJ '' is in large type and accented, 
but -wt ^^■'Sfr •I'Tt ^W%^I ^ is in small type ^ and unaccented. 
Again, ffI''Cf^^^ ^f^ ^fH . . . . ^ is in large type and accented ; 
while trr%'^ f3T'9''^rfT T^ ...."' is in small type and unaccented ; 
and "^Wl" ^ ^"^T t'Tff cTT^ ^3WT ^ is in large type and accented ; 
while MliiJ«Tft ^if*?^ ^^* ^ ^^ ^^ small type and unaccented. 
Again, 'MfJll^^'TT: IfffTTW ^^i;^*^ is in large type" and accented; 
while f"^: ^ TT^t ^^nft %?!%«T ^^ is in small type and unaccented. 
And ^^ ^pfTT^t^^ ■^5(«r%fI'R. ^" is in large type and accented; 
while T^^ "^ ^f^^ ?T%>2n ^* is in small type and unaccented. 

In one case. Roth treats both quotations in the same manner : 
^p^tM: H^'T^rf ^^1^ '^ is in large type ^^ and accented. ^^T^xjf^I^SfiT 
^^yl "^rfTT ^ffT " is also in large type and accented.

EARLIER EDITIONS OF THE NIRUKTA 17 

This practice of Roth is misleading, and is perhaps responsible for the 
fact that several Vedic passages printed in small type are omitted as 
occurring in tlie NirukUL by BloomfieM in his Vedic Concordaiice ; a few 
such examples are the following : ^g^TT* ^^iHfj T: ,^ printed in small type 
and without accents in Roth's edition,'- is not mentioned in VC. as being 
quoted by Yaska, and similarly — 

and also ^(35^ "^^Tf^fTJ^, a fragment of RV. I. 164. 12, and quoted in 
the Nirulda 4. "27, and IHf^^fTI, a fragment of VS. 7. 1, quoted in X. 5. 6, 
are ignored. (Besides the reference of tjt ^(^ ^^'Hf^ ^^T '^ is wrong 
in VC.^ It is quoted in N. 11. 7, and not in N. 10. 7, as stated there. 
Also the reference to q\f^ ''JT! ^"^^1^1*1^ is wrong in VC.,^'^ where it is 
RV. III. 46. 3, while the correct reference is RV. III. 41. 3. Other cases 
are: ^ T^ qiT^ ^3f^{^\ ^%, RV. III. 30. 19c, is wrongly given as IV. 30.

given as IX. 63. 5^ in VC, p. 936^, while the correct reference is VII. 63. 5^) 

TJie Bib. Itid. Editioii of the Nirulda. 

This was published at Calcutta under the editorship of Sdmasrami from 
1882-91. Its chief merit is that it, for the first time, supplies us with the 
commentary of Devardja Yajvan on the Nighantu and of Durga on the 
Ninihta. It also adds an index to the words of the Nighantu as well as to 
the words of the Nirukta. The practical utility of this index, however, 
suffers much from its being separated into three indexes, one for each 
volume and not consisting of one single whole. Besides many misprints 
and errors of Sandhi, the text constituted is not very valuable from the 
critical point of view, and is thus not a trustworthy basis for further 
research. The editor, although his text generally agrees with the shorter

18 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

recension, does not seem to realize that there are two recensions of* the 
text of the Niriikta, and has thus unconsciouslj'" introduced an element of 
eclecticism in his edition. For instance, he omits the phrase : -smNi^* cR^nf(. 
(vol, ii, p. 49), probably on account of its being not found in the manu- 
scripts of the shorter recension, but he puts the line ^TOT: cR^T'JTTr^t 
giT'nWRT ^5^T%^ (vol. ii, p. 132) within brackets in his constituted 
text, although it is omitted by manuscripts of the shorter recension. 
Further, he omits the passage : f ^T ^t f?T^(fVf?I ^T "^ "^^^ f^^^<*4m: 
from his text, adding it in a foot-note with the remark : f;^f%RiI m^t 
(vol. ii, p. 181). This shows that he does not follow any general plan 
with regard to the additional passages of the longer recension, as he some- 
times puts them within brackets in the text itself, and sometimes adds 
them in foot-notes. This would also imply that he does not regard the 
passage, which he puts within brackets, as interpolations, but only those 
which he adds in foot-notes ; this, to say the least of it, is altogether an 
arbitrary distinction, made with reference to the additional passages of the 
longer recension. Further, he is not consistent even in this, for occasionally 
he puts passages of the shorter recension within brackets as well (see 
vol. iii, pp. 121-22). Examples might be multiplied. Both these editions 
(i.e. Roth and Bib. Ind.) are very meagrely punctuated, and many 
sentences, being not properly divided, are misleading or tend to be obscure. 

Tlie Bombay Edition. 

Another excellent edition of the Nirukta, together with Durga's 
commentary, is that of Mahamahopadhyaya, P. Sivadatta, published at 
Bombay in 1912. In type, in paper, and in general get-up it marks a 
distinct improvement on its predecessors. The sentences are intelligentlj^ 
divided, and, to a great extent, the obscurities due to defective punctuation 
in previous editions have been removed. The text followed is that of the 
longer recension, and the criticism to which Roth's text is subject, except 
his inconsistency with regard to the use of large and small type, is applic- 
able to the Bombay edition as well. The editor does not state whether he 
uses any manuscripts or not in the constitution of his text. As a matter 
of fact, as expressly mentioned in his introductory remarks, he has taken 
the two previous editions as the basis of his own work. A critical edition 
of the NiruJda professing to represent the archetype as closely as possible, 
and based on the manuscript material hitherto not utilized is therefore still 
a desideratum. I have, on these grounds, undertaken to edit the Nii'ukta 
afresh.

Detailed Description of Manuscripts.^ 

MS. Max Mailer MemoHal, e. 8. Ml. 

Part I. a.d. 1749. 

Contents : The Nlrukta of Yaska in the longer recension, the text of 
which consists of two manuscripts, containing the two parts (the 2yv^i'vdrdha 
and the uttardrdha) respectively. The work is divided into chapters 
{adhydyas) and sections (khandas) thus : Chapter I, which contains 20 sec- 
tions, begins on f. 1 v. and ends on f. 10 r. Chapter II, 28 sections, ends on 
f. 21 r. Chapter III, 22 sections, ends on f. 32 v. Chapter IV has 27 
sections, and ends on f. 42 v. Chapter V, 28, sections, ends on f. 53 v. 
Chapter VI, 36 sections, ends on f. 68 r. The chapters are written consecu- 
tively, and at the end of each chapter there is added a short summary, 
quoting the first word or words of every section — thus indicating and also 
expressly stating the number of sections in the chapter. The text is 
bounded on both sides by double red lines, sometimes carelessly drawn, 
regularly up to f . 25 r., after which similar red lines only occasionally appear. 
A short red vertical stroke is placed above the letter where it indicates the 
application of the rules of euphonic combination, and is also used to mark 
the termination of a sentence, being thus a sign of punctuation. The 
danda appears at the end of a section only, but also points out the begin- 
ning and ending of a quotation. The red vertical stroke is often confusing 
as the accent in Vedic quotations is also marked with red ink. 

There are two figures drawn vertically in red ink on f . 1 r. One looks 
like a goddess, probably Durgd, seated in a chariot with a flying banner, 
the other is the god Ganeki, seated on an ornamented lotus, to which is 
added in black ink the representation of a small bird, probably a peacock. 
The two figures contain between them the words : {sic) II f'T^W ^^^ 
Trrt'^t II An attempt has been made to colour fF. 14, 29, 42, 49, 64 with 
yellow pigment, which is frequently used also to obliterate, though only 
with partial success, individual words, syllables, and letters. Black pig- 
ment is also employed to obliterate, for instance on f. 24 v., where half 
a line is completely covered. The manuscript is neat, well preserved, and 
accurate. It is the best among those belonging to the longer recension. 

^ From the point of view of the general reader, the detailed description of the manuscripts 
can be much curtailed. But as the manuscripts of the Max Miiller Memorial and Chandra 
Shum Shore collections have not been so far catalogued, this description, in addition to 
supplying information with regard to the manuscripts material available for a critical 
edition, is also intended to serve the purpose of a descriptive catalogue. And as Professor 
A. A. Macdonell is in favour of it, I have retained the whole of it, without any curtailment.

were copied at different times as their respective dates show. And the 
fact that the first part uses the .'^aka era, while the second, the Vikrama 
era, indicates that the former comes from the south, while the latter from 
the north. For the sake of convenience I have used the sign M 1 for both

22 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

MS. Max Mailer Memorial, d. 24. M 3. 

Contents : The Nirukta of Yaska in the shorter recension. The 
imrUista is treated as one chapter, and all the 13 chapters are written 
consecutively, the purvdrdlia being separated from the uttarardlia only by 
the words : {sic) II f;lTT "^TW^ II The text is divided into adhydyas, pddas, 
and khandas thus : Chapter I begins on f . 1 v. with the words II ^ 1%'5TT'EI 
*[??: II has 4 pddas, which end on ff. 3 r., 7 r., 9 v., and 11 v. respectively. 

The sections are numbered continuously — the numbering of sections in

24 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

Injuries : It is a very much injured manuscript ; f. 12 is torn on the left- 
hand side, and the text is restored on a patched-up piece of paper ; a part 
of ff. 23 and 52 is injured and the text is similarly restored ; on f. 153 v. 
and 154 v. the right half is restored ; f. 157 is restored in a different hand- 
writing. Besides, the leaves are torn in innumerable marginal spaces, but 
without injuring the text. 

Peculiarity of spelling : It has preserved the old calligraphy. Some of 
the chief peculiarities are : V^with W is sometimes written as ^FT ; e. g. f . 1 v., 
line 5, TT^sTR is written 3T\iR^. Cf. also f. 1 v., line 6. 

"^ is written as m ; e. g. f . 1 v., line 5, fl% = fn% ; f • 2 v., line 1, ^%^ =o%i^^ ; 
f . 63 r., line 2, %^1\T: = T^^liT: , and so on. 

TJ is occasionally written as |/> e.g. f. 2 r, line 5,'%^='%T^ and ^iqrl 
= WRTfT, line 6, ^V^ = ^VJr{ ; f. 2 v., line 8, ^q^cT^ = ^qT(2IcT^. 

But in the case of 15 this method is not always adhered to ; occasionally 
1J. is written in the ordinary way, e. g., f. 2 v., line 5, "^^T'l^ and not 
^^TTT^ ; f. 2 v., line 7, ^cTT^ and not ^f^ffTTT^ ; f. 63 r., line 2, ■?T^ and 
not ^"RI, ^^« and not ««(i*<^:. 

"# is written as TW, e.g., f. 2 r., line 1, ^: = T'ft: , line 2, ■^^TJ^^^TT^Wt 
= ^=^^^^^?J^W: , line 8, ^t^f^I^TT = ^^ftf'TpRTTt. 

Occasionally tj is written like ^, and the sign of ^ in conjunction is 
added, not at the bottom, but on the side of a letter ; e, g., f . 1 v., line 3, 
^[oSfr^T*^^ = i;(€rT^*T«2I^ ; but f. 2 r, line 1. ^^^ is written in the ordinary 
way ; f. 1 v., line 3, ^: = '^:. 

c(^ is written as a short horizontal stroke in conjunction with otlier 
letters ; e. g., f. 1 v., line 4, '^^Tft = -«4^rR, line 6, ^^ = ^^ ; f. 2 r, Hue 5, 
^f^^Tr^lf^o = ^f%(€I^Tl^*» ; f. 1 v., line 7, ^if = ^. 

cj;^ is occasionally written as a short horizontal stroke, even when it is 
not a conjunct consonant; e.g., f. 2 r., line 2, '^^ = ^"^^, but in conjunc- 
tion with '^ it is written in the ordinary way ; e. g., cf. ■^f^(2I a])ove, and 
1C^?!T», f. 1 v., line 6. There is dittography also, e.g., f. 2 r., line 3, 

The manuscript belongs to a period wlien calligraphy was still in a 
process of transition, consequently it preserves the old and new forms of 
letters side by side ; it cannot therefore be later than the fifteenth century, 
I tliink that among the manuscripts of the Niriihta in tlie Bodleian this is 
the oldest and best manuscript belonging to the shorter recension. 



DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MANUSCRIPTS 25 

MS. Max M'dlleT Memorial, e. 9. M 4. 

Contents : The Nirukta (7-14 chapters ; the parisista is treated as two 
chapters) in the longer recension. The text is punctuated with a short 
and vertical stroke, indicating Saiiulhi and the termination of a sentence, 
while the danda appears at the end of a section, or the commencement 
and end of a quotation. Accent is marked with red ink in Vedic fjuota- 
tions. The work is divided into chapters and sections, thus : Chapter VII

It is a neat, well-written, fairly accurate, and modern manuscript. 

MS. Chandra Shum Shere, d. 178. C 1. 
The text of the Nivulda is made up of two different manuscripts, which 
contain Chapters I-VI and VII-XII respectively, but both are incomplete, 
and both belong to the longer recension. The two parts are separated 
by a fragment of a third manuscript (fF. 38-43), which gives a part of 
Chapters XI and XII. The fragment has no value for the purpose of 
collation, and is therefore ignored. 

Part I. 

Contents: The Nirukta (Chapters I-VI) in the longer recension. 
The text is divided into chapters and sections thus : Chapter I begins on 
f. 1 v., has 20 sections, and ends on f . 7 v ; Chapter II has 28 sections, and 
ends on f. 12 r. ; Chapter III has 22 sections, and ends on f. 18 v.; 



26 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

Chapter IV has 27 sections, and ends on f. 25 r. ; Chapter V has 28 sections, 
and ends on f. 30 r. ; Chapter VI has 35 sections only, the remaining 
sections are missing. The text is bounded on both sides by double red 
lines K 1-21; by double black lines fF. 11 r, 17 v, and 22-36; f. 12 is 
written in a different handwriting. The accent is marked in red ink in 
Vedic stanzas only. Double short vertical red strokes are used to indicate 
sandhi and the end of a sentence, which are replaced by similar black 
strokes from f. 7 v.-f. 12 r., which are again replaced by a similar single 
red stroke ff. 19-30. The danda, as usual, appears at the end of a section 
only, or at the commencement and the termination of a quotation. The 
chapters are written consecutively. Numerous notes are added on the 
margin, and sometimes between the lines of the text also, e.g. fF. 2, 3, 12, 
18 v., 19. At the end of each chapter a short summary, as described on 
page 1, is subjoined : 

Size 13'' X o". 

Material : paper. 

Number of leaves : 1 + 36 + i blank. 

Number of lines: 10 fF. 1-25 ; 11 fF. 26-36. 

Character : Devanagari. 

Date : The last leaves of the manuscript are missing ; neither the date 
nor the name of the scribe is known. From its appearance the manuscript 
looks old, f. 8 is numbered as f. 9, and f. 9 as f. 11, and the mistake con- 
tinues up to the end ; the reference to folios are therefore to the number 
added in pencil. 

Injuries: It is injured in many places, e.g. fF 7-12 on the top (left). 

Part II. 

Contents : The uttarardha of the Nlruhta (Chapters VII-XII) in the 
longer recension. The text is divided into chapters and sections thus: 
Chapter VII begins on f. 1 v. with the words II ^ 1%IIT^ TR: II ^ II has 
31 sections, and ends on f. 11 r (=. f. 54 r.) ; Chapter VIII has 22 sections, 
and ends on f. 15 v. (= f. 58 v.) ; Chapter IX has 43 sections, and ends on 
f . 23 V. ( r3 f . 66 V.) ; Chapter X has 47 sections, and ends on f . 32 r. ( = f . 75 r.) ; 
Chapter XI has 30 sections, and ends on f . 40 v. ( = f . 83 v.) ; Chapter XII 
has 43 sections only, and ends on f. 48 v. (= f. 91 v.) ; the remaining portion 
of the manuscript is missing. All tlie chapters are written consecutively, 
and at the end of each chapter a summary similar to that of Part I is 
added. The text is bounded on both sides by two sets on double black 
lines, fF. 1-34 (ff. 44-77) and fi: 41-48 (ff. 84-91) ; and by similar red lines 
ff 35-40 (ff. 78-83). The accent is marked in red ink in Vedic stanzas

only, and a short vertical red stroke is occasionally used for punctuation ; 
the use of the danda is similar to that of Part I. F. 9 (= f. 52) is written 
in a different handwriting. 

Size: llxV'x4^"- 

Material: paper. 

Number of leaves : 48 + i blank. 

Number of lines : 9-10. 

Character: Devanagari. 

Date: The last part of the manuscript is missing; consequently the 
date and the name of the scribe are not known. 

Injuries : ff. 18 (= 61), 34-40 (= 77-83) are slightly injured in the top 
margin; f. 22 (= 65) is practically defaced by black and yellow ink, and 
f. 28 (= 71) by water. 

MS. Chandra Shum Shere, d. 181. C 2. 
The text is made up of two different manuscripts. 

Part I. 

Contents : The pilrvarcZ^a of the Nirukta in the longer recension. The 
manuscript is fragmentary and incomplete, containing Chapters I, IV, V, 
and a part of the first section of the VI. The text is divided into chapters 
and sections. Chapter I has 20 sections, and ends on f. 13 v. Chapter IV 
has 27 sections, and ends on f. 36 r. Chapter V has 28 sections, and ends 
on f. 40 r. The accent is marked in red ink in Vedic stanzas only, while 
a short vertical red stroke is used for punctuation. The words {dc) 
?f7T ^^ y^Nj im^frWRi: II are v^rongly added at the bottom of f. 1 v. in 
a different handwriting. F. 1 r. has a figure of Ganesa drawn rather 
crudely in red with two female attendants. 

Size: 13i"'x5f". 

Material : paper. 

Number of leaves : i + 40. 

Number of lines : 7-8. 

Character : Devanagari. 

Date and scribe : Not known. 

Injuries : ff. 13-14 are slightly injured by worms. It looks modem. 
The numbering in the original is wrong ; the reference is to the number 
added in pencil. It is full of mistakes. 

Peculiarity of spelling: f. 2, 1. 1 WWT is written as W^^, f. 2, 1. 1 'ft" is 
written as *f. 



28 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

Part II. 
Contents : The uttardrdha of the Nirukta (Chapters VII-XIII) in the 
longer recension. The text is divided into chapters and sections thus : 
Chapter VII has 31 sections, and ends on f. 6 v. (=46 v.) ; the colophon 
adds : ^ ?^T^ ^4|rid<i II ^ II Chapter VIII has 22 sections, and ends on 
f. 10 r. ( = 50 r.) ; Chapter IX has 43 sections, and ends on f. 15 r. (= 55 r.) : 
Chapter X has 47 sections, and ends on £. 20 v ( = 60 v.) -, Chapter XI has 
50 sections, and ends on f . 26 v. ( = 66 v.) ; Chapter XII has 46 sections, 
and ends on f. 32 r. (= 72 r.) ; Chapter XIII begins on f. 32 v. (= 72 v.), 
has 13 sections, and ends on f. 34 v. (= 74 v.); the colophon runs {sic) 

II \f^ f^^w ^^ttt^^ :5rH'ftWT^: II w II "^^ *r^ ii w ii ^ ^Tf TTi»r^?T% -^w, ii 

the last chapter, which is also named XIII, has 37 sections, which are not 
numbered anew, but continuously from the previous section, and ends on 
f. 42 r. (= 82 r.). Chapters VIII-XII are written consecutively, and 
a summary, similar to the one described on p. ] , is added at the end of each 
chapter, but the summary on f . 42 r. ( = 82 r.) also includes that of the first 
13 sections, although the summary of these sections is already subjoined on 
f. 34v. (=74 v.). 

The colophon on f . 42 r ( = 82 r) runs thus : || f;f?f f^^% ^^^iftWT^: II 
The text is bounded on both sides by double black lines, fF. 1-23 (= 41-63) 
and ff. 38-42 (=78-82) by similar red lines, fF. 24-36 ( = 64-76), f. 37 { = 77} 
is coloured yellow. A short vertical red stroke is employed for punctua- 
tion, the dropping of visarga is indicated by adding them on the top of 
the letter just before the red stroke, e.g. f. 1 v. (= 41 v.), 1. 3 : 3T(?I^lJ<!t 
^Wrf^' ; 02X cit 1. 4 : ^5|f t^?I«> ; o^x cit 1. 8 : <»g^Wtlf ^f*Tf?T , and 
so on. 

Occasionally the short red stroke is written Ii, but the sign >J is not 

meant to point out the elision of short a, e.g. o]). cit. 1. 5: TTTt'^f'T^- 
Sometimes i is replaced by x . The dauda appears at the end of a section, 
or at the beginning and end of a quotation. The accent is marked in red 
ink on Vedic stanzas. 

Size: 13V' x5|". 

Material : paper. 

Number of leaves: 42 + i blank.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MANUSCRIPTS 29 

MS. Ghamlra Shum Shere, d. 182. C 3. 
The text of the Niruhta is made up of two manuscripts. 

Part I. 

Contents : The lyiirvdrdha of the Niruhta in the longer recension. The 
work is divided into chapters and sections thus : Chapter I begins on f . 1 v. 
with the words : {dc) ^ 1^1| I ^ TTTT^ -W: , has 20 sections, and ends 
on f. 7 r. Chapter II has 28 sections, and ends on f. 12 r. (ff. 8-9, contain- 
ing sections 3-11 of the second chapter, are missing in the original). 
Chapter III has 22 sections, and ends on f. 18 r. (ff. 19 and 21-23, contain- 
ing sections 11-12 and 14-19, are missing in the original). Chapter IV has 
27 sections, and ends on f. 23 v. Chapter V has 28 sections, and ends on 
f. 29 V. Chapter VI has 36 sections, and ends on f . 38 r. The chapters are 
written consecutively, the summary is added as usual, punctuation and 
accents in Vedic stanzas are marked in red ink. The text is bounded on 
both sides by double black lines, f. 1 r. has a few laudatory verses written 
on it and the words : {sic) ^^ ^f^^^ II t^ ^f^^rf^f^T I ■^^. 

A part of line 9 on f. 5 r., and of line 4 on f. 7 r., of line 5 on f. 7 v., is 
obliterated with black pigment. Two lines are added to the top of f. 13 v., 
f. 19 v. is partially defaced by light red ink, and half a line on f. 20 r. is 
similarly obliterated with red pigment. Colophon on f. 38 r. runs thus : 

II Tf^ f^^ ^^^ -^ ^T^: II ^ TT*i^«5?.i^ 'w: II ^ f%%^TT^ 'm: u 

^*W^ II ^ ^^^^T^ T^: II A female figure is drawn on f. 38 v., and a list 
of several articles is added. The prominent difference of ink, characters, 
carelessness, occasionally disproportionate red vertical strokes, frequent 
use of red ink for marginal notes, smudging of the black ink, give a very 
untidy appearance to the manuscript. 

Size: 12f'x53-V'. 

Material : Paper. 

Number of leaves : i + 38 + i blank. 

Number of lines : 10-11. 

Character : Devanagari. 

Date and scribe : Not known. 

The name of the owner is given on f. 1 r. as Godabole Laksmana Bhatta. 

Peculiarity of spelling: It occasionally writes ^ as "^j e.g., f. 1 v.. line 1, 
^ ^TTTRI = ^ "^nTT^. Like Ml, it frequently doubles t in conjunction 
with other letters, e.g. f. 1 v., line 2, ^nTTf(?I = ^W71^ : line 3, fsfl^- 
^f{^^^\ = i^T^\y\^^^\ ; line 4, ^^tTT = ^-rmPi ; line 8, f%^ = fw^. 



30 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

Part II. 

Contents: The iittardrdha of the Nirukta (Chapters X-XIII) in the 
longer recension. The text is divided into chapters and sections thus : 
Chapter X begins on f. 1 r. ( = 40 r.), has 47 sections, and ends on f. 16 v. 
(=55 v.). Chapter XI has 50 sections, and ends on f. 31 v. (= 70 v.). 
These two chapters are written consecutively. Chapter XII begins with 
li^ T^ICT^ "W: II has 46 sections, and ends on f. 13 v. (= 83 v.). This 
seems to be a different manuscript from the previous one containing 
Chapters X-XI ; the pagination begins anew, the handwriting is different, 
and unlike the former the text is bounded on both sides by double red lines. 
The 'pariiista is separated from Chapter XII, and is treated as one chapter. 
The numbering of leaves starts anew from the first. It begins with II ^ II , 
on f. 1 r. (= 84 r.), has 50 sections, and ends on 14 v. (= 97 v.). The last 
word of the 13th section is repeated, but the summary is added at the 
end of the 50th section. The summary, as usual, is added at the end of 
every chapter. The accent is marked in red ink in Vedic quotations, while 
a short vertical red stroke is used for punctuation. A line in different 
handwriting is added at the bottom of f . 1 v. ( = 40 v.). A line and a half 
in red ink is added on the right-hand margin of f. 22 r. (=61 r.) ; part of 
the 50th section of the eleventh chapter is finished off on the top and right- 
hand margin on f. 31 v. (= 70v.). A line is added on the top of f. 11 v. 
(=81 v.). Section 43 of Chapter XIII is left out in the text, but added 
on the top and the margin on the right on f. 13 r. (= 96 r.). 

Size: 9"x4''. 

Material : Paper. 

Number of leaves : 31 + 13 + 12 (= 58) -^ i blank. 

Number of lines : 7 to 9. 

Character : Devanagari.

^^ttt^I ^H'frwr^: ii 

Injuries : It is slightly injured by worms in several places, e.g. fF. 7-4 
(3= 47-54) and fi". 1-3 (= 84-86). 
It has a modern look. 

MS. Chandra Shum Shere, d. 179. C 4. 

The text is made up of two manuscripts, containing the purvdrdha and 
the uttardrdha, with the loariisista respectively, each being copied by 
a different scribe, at a different place and period. They will therefore be 
separately described.

The numbering of sections does not begin anew in each p>cida, but is 
continuous, and agrees with the longer recension as to the total number of 
sections in Chapters IX-XII. It belongs to the shorter recension. 

MS. Sanskrit, e. 17. S. 

A.I). 178L 

This is described in detail by Keith in the Catalogue of Sanskrit 
Manuscrvpta in the Bodleian Library, vol. ii, p. 105. The text is punctuated 
as usual, and divided into chapters and sections. A summary similar to 
the one described on p. 1 is added at the end of each chapter. It belongs 
to the longer recension. The text is bounded on both sides by two sets of 
double red lines. It is a neat and accurate manuscript. 



THE TEXT OF THE NIRUKTA 39 

The Relationship of the MSS. : two recensions. 

The manuscripts fall into two groups, and for the sake of convenience 
and brevity, may be called A and B — A representing tlie longer and B the 
shorter recension. None of the manuscripts grouped in these two families is 
earlier than A.D. 1479. Although they have been copied from earlier manu- 
scripts — often with great labom* and trouble as some of the scribes remark — 
neither of them transmits the text of the Niruhta in an uninterpolated state. 
Both recensions add the parUista — which can be proved to be an interpola- 
tion by independent testimony — as an integral part of the text, and cannot, 
therefore, be the faithful representatives of the archetype. Moreover, Vjoth 
have besides the imrisista, an entire section or the equivalent of a section 
added on to them. These additions are meaningless. The commentary on 
the Vedic stanzas quoted therein is very poor, and written in a style quite 
different from that of Yaska. For instance, there can hardly be any doubt 
as to the interpolated character of ix. 2, which is given as a constituent part 
of the text by the manuscripts of both recensions. Further, the commentary 
on the Vedic stanza in xi. 7 is meaningless and written in a different 
style. The Vedic stanza, being quite easy, requires no explanation. Yaska 
generally does not comment on easy Vedic stanzas, simply remarking : 
iti so, nigada-vydJchydtd^, i.e. 'this stanza is explained by the mere reading'. 
In all such cases, this note of Yaska comes after easy Vedic stanzas only. 
It would thus be intelligible, if it had followed immediately the Vedic 
stanzas in xi. 7. But as the text now stands, it is placed just after a very 
difficult Vedic stanza in xi. 8. This is contrary to Yaska's method. It is 
clear that the words : iti sd nigada-vydkhydtd were originally placed 
immediately after the Vedic stanzas in xi. 7. The intervening passage is 
an interpolation, and rather a clumsy one, for it can be easily detected. 
This is further proved by the fact that Durga, who repeats every word of 
Yaska in his commentary, ignores them. How these additions gradually 
find their way into the text is illustrated by the following example. There 
is an easy quotation in xii. 2, and Yaska, as usual, simply adds : iti sd 
nigada-vydkhydtd. Some interpolators have endeavoured to add after 
these words a short comment. Thus some manuscripts here subjoin the 
following remark : ^^Tf^T^ ^ '^^ ^^TTT^ TJrl'^t ^^ ^TTrl^: II 

Further, each recension contains passages, which, being superfluous, are 
omitted by the other, or are amplified versions of those in the other. For 
example, B adds, between vii. 19 and 20, one entire section, which is omitted 
by A. It is clearly an interpolation as the commentary on the Vedic 
stanzas is identical with that of xiv. 33 with slight alterations. 

1 Cf. N. X. 18, 24 ; xi. 3, 45; xii. 31. 



40 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

Again, in B the commentary on the Vedic stanza quoted in v. 27, reads 

as follows : g%^^ ^^TT!j^^ ^^ cT^ %y( ^ l^vim mwim^^^T^ <*l^< 

A's version of this is greatly amplified : 

fW«Ttf^ TT I fT^TT^rr^^^fT^f^ f^sft JT^fTT II ^^ II 

Further, A contains a long passage in 6.5 : ^^ '^Wt'MM^ .... QSTr^TrTTt 
omitted by B. 

d. ' Omissio ex homoeoteleuto ' in Sanskrit Manuscripts. 

It is clear, therefore, that both the recensions cannot faithfully represent 
the archetype. Hence the question arises which of them adheres more 
closely to the original? Roth adopted the text as given by the longer 
recension in his edition, without, however, assigning adequate reasons for 
his preference. The same text is also adopted by most of the editors of 
the Niriihta. This text, as has been shown above, does not represent the 
original. It is true that often the longer recension preserves the better 
text, for sometimes passages are omitted by accident. The eye of the 
scribe wanders from a particular word to the same or to a similar word, 
occurring further on in the text, with the result that the intervening 
words are omitted. This phenomenon known as omissio ex homoeoteleuto 
is universal and of very frequent occurrence. The following example 
illustrates this kind of omission. In copying the lines : ' The book, which 
is rather scarce, was till very lately of absolute necessity for the Student of 
the Christian hymnology, above all for the Student of Adam of St. Victor's 
hymns V the eye of the copyist wandered from the student of the first to 
the same word in the second line and the words ' of the Christian .... for 
the ' were left out. The same thing happened to the scribe of MS. C 3. 
In copying the sentence: ^"^^^^^cT df^HHUll tj^^t^n, I "WtT^TTf-

consequently the intervening words J^^i: "^WTS .... f^f^f^^ were 
omitted in MS. C 3.

shorter recension is always the best, for sometimes omissions are accidental. 

e. Dittography in Sanskrit Manuscripts. 

On the other hand, there is also the phenomenon called dittographj^ 
i. e. the repetition or addition of a few words or sentences. An excellent 
example of dittography is furnished by The Globe on July 9, 1915. 

' The Echo de Paris publishes a message from Cettinje announcing the 
message from Cettinje announcing the appointment as Governor of Scutari 
of Bojo Petrovitch.' ^ The part of the second line is a verbatim repetition 
of a part of the first line.

Vedic stanza, and he mechanically copies the whole of the fu'st line except 
^fT ^ in MS. C 5. 

Again, in N. vi. 8, the scribe of the MS. Mi. repeats ^[^Tf?Tofi^T ^^ 
Further there are some passages whose omission by B is absolutely 
unjustifiable. Yaska explains every word occurring in the fourth chapter 
of the Ni(jhaiitii. The omission of the passages containing the explana- 
tion of anj^ of these words is therefore inconsistent with Yaska's plan. 
Examples of such omissions are the following. Yaska explains f^P^JTr^ 
{Ngh. 4. 3. 12) in N. vi. 3, but the passage : t^^^TT f^T^T^ErfTtTW* is omitted 
by B. Again, Yaska explains ^Uj^ {^gh. 4. 3. 28) in N. vi. 6 as "^tw^ 
^'^4ii^. which is omitted by B. This omission makes the following Vedic 
quotation meaningless. 

Further, in commenting upon a Vedic stanza, Yaska always starts from 
the very beginning of the stanza. To leave out the first few words and. to

begin from somewhere in the middle of the stanza is altogether foreign to 
his practice, yet if the text of B be followed, the omission of the passage : 
*<«)l*i«l ^^U!iny«n fil«l«rf1 (N, vi. 26) would involve Yaska in an incon- 
sistency. All this shows that B is not absolutely reliable. 

Now let us examine A. The majority of the manuscripts of A belong 
to a period later than those of B. Thus, not one of them has preserved 
the old spelling, while most of the B MSS. retain this peculiarity, i.e.

Again, some of the A MSS. divide the pariiista into the so-called 
thirteenth and the fourteenth chapters, while those of B put the whole of 
the parisista into one chapter only, which is numbered the thirteenth. 

It has already been pointed out that A contains an obvious interpolation 
in N. vi. 5, and an amplified version of B's comment in N. v. 27. Besides 
these there are shorter passages scattered throughout the book which are 
omitted by B and are suspected to be interpolations. One very fertile and 
insidious source of interpolations is supplied by Yaska's own method of giving 
etymological explanations. He does not content himself with one deriva- 
tion, but goes on adding derivation after derivation of a single word till 
the whole list of probable, possible, and even fanciful etymologies is 
exhausted. In many cases, interpolators found it quite easy to add new 
derivations and attribute them to Yaska. A contains a considerable 
number of such additions, while B has only two. 

The following are a few samples : 

N. ii. 6. A reads : ^^ W^^^f^ I f^T "^j fdad^fH Wl I ^ f^^J^f^TT- 
^Frawirr: I f^fIT5R^?RIfi: ....

this particular case it is obvious that the passage ^^ oR^HrT, &c., is an

give the etymological explanation of f%^^ first and then of ^^, not

Instances might be multiplied, but the above examples suffice to show 
that A has been much more tampered with than B. 

Fortunately, as has been said above, Durga repeats every word of the 
Nirukta in his commentary, so that the text of the Nirnkta * in toto ' can be 
reproduced from his commentary alone. This commentary therefore serves 
the purpose of a manuscript of the Nirukta and supplies valuable information 
al)Out the condition of the text in its author's time. Durga does not 
recognize the pari^ista as an integral part of the Nirukta, as in fact he is 
even unaware of its existence. Thus his commentary preserves the text 
of the Nirukta as current before the addition of the parisida. Further, 
it derives great value from the fact that Durga displays critical judgement 
in the adoption of readings in the text, while giving variants and adding 
critical notes on them. For example, in N. i. 2, he reads ^^^?^ but

gives ^TRf!^ as a variant, adding : ^'TR^r'raT^rTO^'R^r^^'rrflTcg^TTcjf^

This shows that Durga took pains to ascertain the correct readings and 
has handed down a sort of critical edition of the Nirukta, as it existed in 
his time, 

/. 1. Three stages of interpolations. 

We have thus manuscript materials which belong to three distinct periods. 

(1) D, i.e. the commentary of Durga, written before the edition of 
the 'pariiiistas and embodying the whole text of the Xii^ukta, represents 
the earliest period, i.e. about the thirteenth century a.d. 

(2) B, i. e. the manuscripts of the shorter recension represent a 
period later than D, — when the 'parii>ktas were added, but not divided 
as yet into different chapters, and when the old orthograpliy was still 
prevalent. 



46 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

(3) A, i. e. the manuscript of the longer recension, represents a still 
later period when the pari&istas had been divided into chapters and the 
old orthography had gone out of use. 

A collation of these three different recensions indicates that three 
distinct stages of interpolations in the Nirukta can be clearly traced. For 
example, let us take a passage in N. i. 4. On collating D, B, and A, we 
find that the reading of D has been expanded in B, and that of B in A. 

N. i. 4. D reads : ^'qi^f^f^^ ^^Tf^f?r ^^^T^ I ^f^f^c^twf^ | 

B reads : W^Hf^f^^ ^^f^ ^^T^*l I ^=^ WTTt ^Tf^I^T-

A reads: W^^f^fl^^ fmf^fH ^^^^l I ^TT^ ^i^TRTJ ^=^ 

Another example for these three stages is suppled by N. ix. 2, as 
follows :

It has been shown above that the list of etymologies increases as one 
passes from the text of B to that of A. In the same manner the list 
of etymologies increases in B as compared with D. The following are 
some examples.

/. 2. Parallel instance of Servius, commentator of Virgil. 

Tims the stages of interpolation at different periods can be traced. 
The principle of the ' best MSS.' is obviously inapplicable in this case, 
for none of the manuscripts can be called the best. All that is available 
is the best manuscript of each family, and the best plan, under the circum- 
stances, would be to place all the three families side by side. Fortunately 
it is possible to do so, for the successive interpolations from one family to 
another are invariably the amplifications of the text of a shorter recension, 
and are thrust between sentences wherever the text could be so enlarged 
with impunity, as, for instance, in multiplying the number of etymologies 
and attributing them all to Yaska. I have, however, distinguished the 
evidence of Durga's commentary from that of the manuscripts of the 
Niriilda, although Durga's commentary is very important for supplying 
such valuable evidence for the history of the text of the Ninikta, it cannot, 
strictly speaking, be called a manuscript of the Nirukta. The relation of 
tlio shorter to the longer recension is shown by the use of square brackets, 
wliicli contain tlie additional passages of the longer recension, while the 
relation of the shorter recension to the text preserved by Durga is indicated 
by foot-notes. An analogous example is furnished by Latin literature. The 
text of Servius, commentator of Virgil, shows a similar threefold amplihca- 



THREE STAGES OF INTERPOLATIONS 49 

tion, the three stages of interpolation being pointed out by Thilo in his 
edition. I think the text of the Niriikta reproduced from Durga represents 
tlie archetype as closely as it is possible to restore it with the lielp of the 
present materials. I have collated^ sixteen manuscripts myself, besides 
taking into account fourteen manuscripts collated by Rotli, and eiglit V.y 
the editor of the Nlrulda in Bib. Ind. Thus, directly and indirectly, tlie 
evidence of about forty manuscripts has been available for this edition, and 
the text may therefore be regarded as more or less settled. 

g. Commentators of Yaska. 

Although, from an early period, Yaska's work has been recognized as 
one of the most important veddiigas by the orthodox tradition of literary 
India, he, unlike Panini, has not had many commentators. This does not 
mean that he had few followers or that his speculations did not dominate 
the thought of succeeding generations. On the contrary, he has been 
acknowledged to be the pre-eminent authority on etymology. Hence (at 
first sight) it seems rather inexplicable that his work should have been com- 
mented upon by so few people. One reason of this paucity is that Yaska's 
work itself is a commentary and not an independent treatise, hence it did 
not stand in need of much elucidation. Secondly, it is written in classical 
Sanskrit prose, and, notwithstanding its somewhat archaic and terse style, 
is easily intelligible to the reader as compared, for instance, with the 
aphorisms of Panini ; consequently there was not much demand for further 
comment. Yet three commentators, at least, are known to have elucidated 
Yaska's work. 

(1) Ugra is mentioned as a commentator on the Nirukta by Aufrecht 
in his Gatalogus CJatalogorum.^ But no other information, about his 
personality, the character of his work, and the time when he lived, is 
available. No reference is made to him by any of the other writers in 
the same lield. 

(2) The second commentator is Skandasvami, mentioned by Deva- 
rajayajvan.^ A manuscript of his work exists in the Bibliotheciue 
Nationale, Paris,* and a friend of mine from Lahore has recently informed 
me that he has obtained a complete manuscript of his commentary. 

^ Since then, on my visit to Paris, I have nil represent the text of the longer recension, 

been able, through the courtesy of Professor and do not afiford any other variants. The

50 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

(3) But the most important of all these commentators is Durga. He 
seems to be later than Devarajayajvan who is familiar with the then extant 
commentaries on the Vedas, the Nighantu, and the Nirukta, and who does 
not mention Durga in the long list of the authorities used by him for the 
purpose of his own work. Although a conclusion based on the argument 
of silence is not cogent, yet in this particular case, it is justified to assume 
that Durga is not referred to because he was posterior to Devaraja, hence 
Durga would also be later than Skandasvami. Durga's commentary is 
published, and has superseded the works of his predecessors. His work 
is important for two reasons : (1) he is the last of the commentators, and 
therefore represents the fullest development of the traditional interpretation 
of the Nirukta ; (2) the very fact that it has survived at the cost of earlier 
commentaries indicates its importance. We shall therefore examine his 
work somewhat in detail. 

Date of Durga. 

It has already been pointed out that in all probability he is later than 
Devarajayajvan, though this assumption hardly helps us, for the date of 
Devaraja himself is not known. However, Durga's lower limit can be 
determined almost with certainty. A manuscript ^ of his commentary in the 
Bodleian Library is dated 1387 a.d. The date is genuine and is accepted as 
such by Professor A. B. Keith. ^ The manuscript was copied at Bhrgu Ksetra 
in the reign of Maharana — Durgasirbhavijaya. Thus he could not be 
later than 1387 a.d. It is difficult to identify any particular site with Bhrgu 
Ksetra, but probably it was situated somewhere between the SarasvatI and 
the Jamna. As Durga wrote his commentary in a hermitage near Jammu, 
a place not easily accessible in the absence of modern means of communi- 
cation, the migration of the MS. of his commentary to Bhrgu Ksetra 
presupposes the lapse of sufficient time in order to account for the spreading 
of his fame as a commentator from the isolated heights of Jammu to the 
plains of Bhrgu Ksetra. It will not be far from the truth, therefore, to 
place Durga about the thirteentli century a. d. 

Durga does not speak of any predecessors by name nor does he leave 
any clue as to the sources of his own commentary. Unlike Devaraja- 
yajvan, he does not give the slightest information about himself or the 
general state of the Nirukta during his time. Tliat he wrote his com- 
mentary in a hermitage near Jammu is proved by the colophon^ on f. 132 v. 
at the end of the eleventh chapter of the Nirukta, which runs as follows :

COMMENTATORS OF YASKA 51 

izrr^^ "^5^- ^^' ^TTH' I This shows that the full name of the 
commentator was Durgasiiiiha. The fact that he lived in a hermitage and 
was addressed as bhagavat indicates that he was an ascetic and belonged to 
some particular order of Sannyasa. Further, he is a descendant of the 
family of the Vasisthas. He does not explain the stanza RV. III. 53. 23, 
quoted ^ by Yaska to illustrate the meaning of the word lodhain, because 
the stanza implies hostility to Vasistha. He says : ^f^fWTT 1J^ 11^* W\ 
^fW^fwt ^^ I "^i ^ ^IITfxm^ Trf%^: I ^cT^t ^ f^^ftfir l ' The stanza, 
in which this word (loclham) occurs is hostile to Vasistha. And I am a 
descendant of Vasistha, belonging to the Kapisthala branch, hence I do 
not explain the stanza.' ^ 

Sayana has the following note on it : i^TTr ^^ R ^ rf^T^fST^: ^<^T«1 W 

' There was formerly a royal sage named Sudas, a disciple of Vi^va- 
mitra. Somehow, he became an object of Vasistha's hatred. Then, Vi^va- 
mitra, in order to protect his disciple, reviled Vasistha with these stanzas. 
These are the imprecatory stanzas. The Vasisthas do not pay any attention 
(lit. listen) to them.' ^ This corroborates Yaska's statement that there are 
stanzas which contain asseveration and imprecation only.* 

Durga's commentary is important for it repeats every word of Yaska, 
thus the text of the Nirukta ' in toto ' could be reproduced from Durga's 
work alone. As none of the manuscripts collated by me is older than the 
fifteenth century, Durga supplies therefore evidence of a very valuable 
character for the textual criticism of the Nirukta. The number of variants 
attributed by Durga to his predecessors and his frequent remarks that the 
text is corrupt and that the right reading is to be discovered, — all such 
cases I have pointed out in my notes, — indicate that there has been no 
unbroken tradition with regard to the handing down of the text of the 
Nirukta. 

Further there seems to have been some sort of revival of the study of 
the Nirukta in the neighbourhood of Jammu in Durga's time, for it seems 
difficult to imagine that in an isolated place like Jammu, Durga sat down 
to write his commentary simply for the love of writing a commentary. 
It is more reasonable to suppose that Durga accomplished this task in order

52 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

to meet the demand for a good text, elucidation of* obscure passages, and 
amplification of Yaska's arguments, a demand which a revival of the study 
of the Niriikta had called forth. The examination of the manuscript of 
Durga's commentary, mentioned above, leads one to the conclusion that 
Durga did not live to complete his work and that he himself wrote his 
commentary up to the end of the 11th chapter only. This is indicated by 
a comparison of coloj)hons in the manuscript which, at the end of the 
7th-12th chapters, numbered as 12-17 by Durga consecutively from the 
five chapters of the Nighaiitii, are as follows : 

(1) At the end of the 7th chap, on f . 50 r. II ^T^lftWr^: II 

(2) „ ,, 8th chap, on f. 70 v. II T^ U\^f^ ^^ • • • WT^: II 

(3) „ „ 9th chap, on f. 86 v. II ^^^^ f^ • • • ^^H^ II 

(4) „ „ 10th chap, on f. 112r. || ^^ . . . q^^fTwT^: ^^TTF^ II 

(5) „ ,, nth chap, on f. 132 v. || ^^^^ f^lffrfr W^^T" 

^mr^: ii 

A comparison of these five colophons shows that the first four do not 
contain any reference to Durga by name nor to his honorific titles, which 
fact implies that they were written by Durga himself, while that at the 
end of the 11th chapter was added by some disciple, who speaks of Durga 
as an dc.drya and addresses him as bhagavat. Durga could not have 
appropriated these titles himself unless he was very vain. Another point 
in favour of the fifth colophon being written by a person other than Durga 
is that while the first four colophons say that such and such a chapter has 
come to an end, the fifth remarks that such a pdda of that chapter has come 
to an end. The colophon at the end of the 1 1th chapter is the final inscription 
and as such should have been placed at the end of the 12th chapter, where 
no such description is found; the colophon there, on f. 150 r., being || ¥H^^I^ 
^^^t xn^: II This leads one to the conclusion that Durga himself wrote 
his commentary up to the end of the 11th chapter, whose colophon was 
added by a disciple who also wrote the commentary on the 12th chapter, 
and faithfully refrained himself from adding the name of Durga in the 
colophon at the end of the 12th chapter. MS. Mill 142, dated a.d. 1839, 
and described in the Catalogues of Sanskrit Manuscrij^ts in the Bodleian 
Jjibrary by Keith,^ also preserves the final inscription at the end of the 
nth chapter, while on f. 123 v.. at the end of the 12th chapter it simply 
says II 44H<^(^ ^^^' ^^' H I^ is also to be noticed that in this manuscript

COMMENTATORS OF YASKA 53 

as well, the word adhydya only is used in the earlier colophons while pdda 
makes its appearance in those at the end of the 11th and the 12th chapters. 
Another point of minor importance may also be adduced in this con- 
nexion, i.e. the manuscripts have the following iloka at the end of the 
12th chapter. 

As Durga is shown to be a hermit, to ascribe these verses to him will be 
highly inappropriate. 

Durga and the Parisista. 
Both the published editions of Durga's commentary regard the com- 
mentary on the portions of the 13th chapter as an integral part of Durga's 
work. But the MS. Wilson 475,^ dated 1387 a.d., and MS. Mill 142 \ 
dated 1839 a.d., do not contain the commentary on the 13th chapter. In 
both these manuscripts the commentary is completed at the end of the 
12th chapter and the MS. Mill 142, expressly say that the work is finished. 

II ^WTFt ^5si: II 

Moreover, the 13th chapter was not added to the Xirukta by Durga's time, 
as is proved by his remark in the inti'oductory part of his commentary : 

cT%^*nf^^T^?l I ^^T^T^: ^?rp?Tfi: ii 

'And this (the Nirukta) is its (the NighantvJs) amplified commentary 
consisting of twelve chapters whose first sentence is " a list has been handed 
down by tradition ".' Hence the commentary on the 13th chapter was 
written at a later period and attributed to Durga by some disciple or 
follower of his. 

Yaska's contributions to Etymology, Philology, and Semantics. 

1. Date of Ydska. 

History is the one weak point of Sanskrit literature, being practically 

non-existent. Not a single systematic chronological record has survived, 

and so complete is the lack of any data to guide us in this matter that 

the dates of even the most famous Indian authors like Panini and 

Kalidasa are still subject to controversy. Yaska's date cannot therefore 

be determined with absolute certainty. One can arrive at a relative date 

^ This evidence is, however, inadequate. view I am now systematically examining and 

To make the case plausible, it must be corro- comparing the commentary on the twelfth 

borated by the internal evidence, i.e. the with that of the preceding chapters. Later 

difference of style, treatment, &c. With this on I shall add the result of my examination. 



54 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

only by bringing together the isolated pieces of information supplied by 
archaeological finds, literary references, and accidental mention of known 
historical or political events. This evidence, however, is not conclusive, 
and is differently interpreted by various oriental scholars. There is a 
great difference of opinion among them about the precise date of Yaska, 
but at the same time there is also the unanimity which sets down his 
lower limit as not later than 500 b. c. As this limit has not been 
questioned so far (while his upper limit is carried as far as 700 B.C.), it may 
therefore be safely assumed that Yaska lived at least about a century 
earlier than Plato. Both Yaska and Plato sum up as it were the results of 
their predecessors in philological and etymological investigations in the 
Mrukta and the Cratylus respectively. Both stand pre-eminent with 
regard to their age, and have dominated the thought of succeeding genera- 
tions in their respective countries. Yaska's work is important for the 
history of philology and etymology. And as the representative record of 
the researches of ancient Indians, it is of considerable interest for a com- 
parative study of the Indian and Greek achievements in these two branches 
of knowledge in the earliest period of their history. 

2. Phonetic equipment of Yaska. 

Before we proceed to examine, in detail, the principles laid down by 
Yaska for etymology, or his speculations in philology, it will be worth 
while to inquire whether Yaska was a properly qualified person to under- 
take the task, i.e. whether he possessed any knowledge of sound-laws, 
or, in other words, whether he received any phonetic training, and of 
what sort ? As has already been pointed out, historical and biographical 
records about ancient India do not exist, or at least, if they existed, 
have not survived. Nothing definite is, therefore, known about the life 
of Yaska, nor about the period in which he lived, nor about the educational 
system which then prevailed. In the absence of such records it is there- 
fore extremely difficult to ascertain the worth of his qualifications, or the 
extent of, and his familiarity with, sound-laws. Yet some indirect in- 
formation can be pieced together by collecting a few isolated data capable 
of throwing some light on the subject. In the first place, Yaska is 
acquainted with a vast amount of Sanskrit literature. The numerous 
exemplary quotations occurring in the Nlrukta conclusively show that 
he knew the Rg-veda, the Sama-veda, the Atharva-veda, the Yajur-veda, 
and their pada-pdtltas, the Taittirlya ^mhhitd, the Maitrdyanl Samhitd, 
the Kdthaka Samhitd, the Aitareya Brdhmana, the Gopatha Brdhmaria, 
the Kausitakl BrdJirruiiia, the tiaiapatJm Brdhmana, the Prdtimkhyas^ 



ETYMOLOGY, PHILOLOGY, AND SEMANTICS 55 

and some of the Upanisads. The full list of all the works known to him 
is given in the Appendix. This shows that Yaska was a man of compre- 
hensive knowledge and vast reading. Secondly, he refers to and quotes 
the opinions of the various schools of thought which existed in his time, 
i. e. the school of etymologists, the .school of grammarians, the school of 
ritualists, the school of legendists, the school of Nalddnati (i. e. specialists, 
in primary causes). Further, he discusses and criticizes the views of many 
authorities — his predecessors and contempoi-aries. The full list of the.se 
is also given in the Appendix. The mention of eminent .scholars and 
schools of thought presupposes specialization in their respective depart- 
ments of knowledge which implies some uniform system of training and 
a sufficiently high order of education extending over a long period. 
Otherwise it is difficult to conceive how these various schools could have 
come into existence at all. Thus it can be assumed without much doubt 
that Yaska had received some kind of training in one, or more than one, 
of these schools. He discusses the doctrines of the schools other than 
his own, and thus seems to have acquired a general familiarity with them 
to be able to do so. Thirdly, he distinctly mentions the prdtiklkhyas, 
i. e. phonetic treatises which record the researches made by ancient 
Indians in the physiological and the acoustic aspects of Phonetics. These 
treatises themselves presuppo.se the existence of the pad i-pdthas, i.e. 
'the word texts', which give every word of the sariihltd in its isolated 
state, i. e. free from the euphonic combinations, and analyse compounds 
into their component elements. Gradually by the time of Yaska, a strong 
phonetic feeling had come into existence, as is evident from the scientific 
arrangement and classification of the Sanskrit alphabet. This shows 
that Yaska was furnished with some phonetic equipment, such as 
the state of the scholarship of the time permitted him to acquire. This 
view is supported by the fact that Yaska is familiar with and recognizes 
the following phonetic phenomena : (1) Syncope as in WT^l (they went) 
from the root ^TR^ (to go) ; (2) Metathesis as in ^^ ' a drop ' from "gcj^ 
(to drop), "?^: (rope) from ^^^ (to emit), and cT^ ' knife' from Wr[ (to cut), 
and so on ; (3) Anaptyxis, as in '^n'^ni^ from the root "II^ (to throw), 1[TT« 
(door) from the root ^ (to cover), *T^3n: from the root ^JT^^ (to fry), &c. ; 
(4) haplology as in g^ = tri + rca, i.e. ' three stanzas '} He is also acquainted 
with assimilation, and has noticed an example of prakrtization in the 
Rg-veda while explaining ^iZ'W by gtd*$J (N. v. 24). For the detailed 
account of his observations on phonetic phenomena see Chapter II, sections 

1 All these words are found in tlie Niriikia, ii. 1-2. I have cited examples furnished by 
Yaska liimself. 



56 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

1-2. From what has gone before, it may Le concluded that Yaska was 
a man of extensive reading, that he had pursued a systematic course of 
study, and that he was furnished with some phonetic equipment. This con- 
clusion is further supported by the fact that his explanations are pervaded 
with a rationalistic spirit and devoid of the mystifying or supernatural 
element, a characteristic of the ritualist and the parivrdjaha school, cf. 
e. g. Yaska's explanation of Vrtra. He is altogether free from fanaticism, 
bigotry, and intolerance when he meets Kautsa's adverse criticism of what 
he believes to be the revealed hymns, but gives rational answers to the 
various points of objection. He is actuated by a scientific spirit even 
when he is dealing with gods. Thus, for instance, he classifies gods into 
various groups, i. e. the terrestrial, the atmospheric, and the celestial 
according to the sphere of their activity, and assigns definite functions 
to each. Yaska's classification of gods has nothing corresponding to it 
in the mythologies of other nations. Further, his treatment of synonyms 
and homonyms is also scientific. At first he attributes a particular meaning 
to a particular word, and then supports his assertion by quoting a passage, 
generally from the Vedic literature, in which that word is used in that 
particular sense. Whether or not one agrees with him in attributing 
particular meanings to particular words, it cannot be denied that his 
method is scientific and, notwithstanding his remote antiquity, surprisingly 
modern. This scientific spirit, so evident in the Nirulda, could be developed 
by a scientific training only. In the absence of any definite information, 
the preceding statement will, I think, give some indication as to Yaska's 
qualifications to undertake the task which he set before himself. 



3, hnportance of Etymology. 

Taking both the East and the West together, Yaska is the first writer 
on etymology. He is also the first to treat it as a science by itself. 
According to the orthodox Indian tradition, the Nirulda has, for a long 
time, been recognized as a treatise which deals specially with etymology. 
But the claim of Yaska is not based on this recognition. He has enunciated 
his doctrines in the Nirukta. His remarks on the importance of etymology 
may sound very commonplace to us, but probably appeared to have the 
same' profoundness of wisdom when they were first uttered about 2,500 
years ago, as President Wilson's fourteen points for the modern political 
world. His arguments for etymology are summarized as follows : 

(1) Etymology is essential for the proper understanding of the Vedic 
texts. 



ETYMOLOGY, PHILOLOGY, AND SEMANTICS 57 

(2) Etymology is the complement of grammar.* 

(3) Etymology is necessary for the analysis of the sarhhltd into the 
'pada-'poAha, and of words into their component elements. 

(4) Etymology has practical utility, for it enables one to discover the 
primary deity of a stanza which bears the characteristic marks of more 
than one deity, and thus helps to perform the sacrifice with perfection. 

(5) Etymology is a science, and should be studied for its own sake, 
for knowledge is commended, and ignorance is condemned. (Chapter I, 
sec. 15-17.) 

4. Frlnciples of Etymology. 

Yaska's fundamental notion about language is, that all words can be 
reduced to their primordial elements which he calls roots. With this idea 
he lays great emphasis on the point that as every word can be traced 
to an original root, one should never give up a word as underivable. His 
first general principle is, ' One should give the etymological explanation 
of words whose accent and grammatical form are regular, and are ac- 
companied with a radical modification in the usual manner ', i. e. in 
accordance with the laws of phonology. One would hardly question the 
derivation of ^^^^ from tf^ ' to cook ', or of xn3«fi from t^ ' to read ', or of 
^^ from ora ' to know ' , or of 5t^ from ^^ ' to break ', and so on. It should 
be observed that Yaska recognized the importance of accent, and accords it 
a due place in his principle. It is obvious that the above-mentioned rule 
is limited in its scope, for only a comparatively small number of words can 
fulfil the conditions therein laid down. Yaska therefore strikes a note 
of warning and says that a disproportionate importance should not be 
attached to grammatical form, for the rules of grammar are not universal 
like laws of nature, and have many exceptions, adding that one has also to 
take into consideration phonetic phenomena such as syncope, metathesis, 
haplology, anaptj^xis, assimilation, &c. His second principle is that in 
case the accent and grammatical form are not regular, and are not ac- 
companied with a radical modification, one should always take his stand 
on the meaning of the word and endeavour to derive it from some similarity 
of form, or if there is no such similarity of form, even from the similarity 
of a single letter or syllable. Thus, according to Yaska, one should not 
be afraid to derive, dois, du, doive, dusse, &c. from devoir, ' to owe ', or istl 
(sacrifice) from the root yaj (to sacrifice), on account of the apparent 
dissimilarity of their form. Comparative philology furnishes the best 
examples to illustrate Yaska's remark that often there is hardly any 
resemblance between a word and its original source, i. e. its primitive 

^ Tad idam vidyd-sihanam vyakaranasya kdrtsnyam. N. i. 1.5. 



58 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

and derivative forms. Cf. IE. ^penque ; Skt. panca ; Zend, pauca ; Gk. 
Trej/re ; hat. quinque; hith. 2^enke ; Goth. Jimf; Germ, /im/; O'E,. Jif; Eng. 
Jive. Again, French larme and Engjish tear have only r in common, both 
being otherwise quite different from their original source *dakru, which 
assumed an Anglo-Saxon form tear, and a primitive Lat. dacru. The Eng. 
e^ve and Lat. ovis have nothing in common, and each has exclusively preserved 
some parts of their original *otvis. Eng. /our. Germ, vier, have only r in 
common with Gk. rirrape?. Eng. quick (orig. ' alive ') has only i in common 
with Gk. ^109 (life). Eng. sit, and Gk. hed {eSpa, 'seat') have nothing 
in common, and each has preserved one exclusive part of the original *sed. 
Again, cf. IE. "^ghans; Skt. hamsa; Gk. x'?^; ^^^- <^('nser (for hanser); 
Germ. Gans ; OE. gos ; Eng. goose. 

But the application of this rule by an incompetent person gives rise 
to grotesque results ; many such cases are supplied by the Nirukta, e. g. 
Sakatayana's derivation of Sat-ya, the ya of which he formed from the 
causal of i, and Sat from as, 'to be '. Yaska foresaw the danger of the 
misuse of his principle. So after laying down his rule, he adds a note of 
warning. He urges that single words isolated from their context should 
not be thus derived, for without a knowledge of the context, it is often 
difficult to know the precise meaning of a word. He recommends that 
derivations should not be explained for a person not acquainted, or not 
well acquainted, with grammar, and not for one who has not studied 
etymology as a pupil. He says, ' One should indeed explain derivations 
for one's own pupil who has been in residence studying etymology or for 
one who is capable of understanding ; for the intelligent and for the 
diligent.' N. ii. 3. 

The third principle of etymology laid down by Yaska is that one should 
derive words in accordance with their meanings. ' If their meanings are 
the same, their etymologies should be the same, if the meanings are 
different, the etymologies should also be different.' (N. ii. 7.) 

This principle is on the whole sound, for in every language there occurs 
the phenomenon that words of different origin often assume the same form.

ETYMOLOGY, PHILOLOGY, AND SEMANTICS 63 

from more than one original source, they are liable to be connected with 
the wrong root unless the derivation is based on the meaning. Yaska's 
nile is therefore sound. 13ut in criticism of Yaska's rule, it may be 
remarked that words, having the same origin, come to acquire different 
meanings. For instance, Lat. ru2){cupich), ' to desire ', and Skt. kup, ' to 
be angry', have the same common origin. Again, cf. IE. Idutds ; Skt. 
irutds; Gk. acXi/to?; lia^t. (in)clutus ; OFi.hlud; Eng.loud. Yaska did not 
know any other language besides Sanskrit, his horizon was therefore 
necessarily limited, yet his familiarity with the two phases of the Sanskrit 
language, i.e. the Vedic and the clas.sical, which is historically the develop- 
ment of the former, and which in their relation to each other bear a close 
correspondence to that of the Ionic and the Attic tongues, placed him on 
a better working ground than those who were not fully conscious of such 
historical development. There is no passage in the Cratylus, for instance, 
showing that Plato realized that the Attic was historically the outgrowth 
of the Ionic language. On the contrary, the following passage indicates 
that he was not aware of any such development. 



5. Plato on Etymology. 

Soc. ' Yes, my dear friend ; but then j^ou know that the original names 
have been long ago buried and disguised by people sticking on and 
stripping off letters for the sake of euphony, and twisting and bedizening 
them in all sorts of ways. . . . And the additions are often such that at 
last no human being can possibly make out the original meaning of the 
word.' ^ Again, Plato does not recognize that et}' mology has an}' scientific 
or even systematic basis. He does not seem to realize that derivation of 
words should be governed by some general rules. In addition to the 
above, I quote the following passage in support of my statement : 

Soc. . . . ' Now attend to me ; and first, remember that we often put 
in and pull out letters in words and give names as we please and change 
the accents.'^ Evidently he did not attach much importance to accent. 
The only principle, which can hardly be so called, is contained in the 
following passage : 

Soc ' And whether the syllables of the name are the same or 

not the same, makes no ditterence, providing the meaning is retained ; nor 
does the addition or subtraction of a letter make anj^ difference so long 

^ Jowett, Dialogues of Plato (3rd ed.), vol i, p. 358. 
- Ibid. p. 341. 



64 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

as the essence of the thing remains in possession of the name and 
appears in it.' ^ 

These three passages from the Cratylus indicate that Plato looked 
upon etymology as a compendium of individual conjecture which would 
justify Voltaire's famous satire that, ' Etymology is a science in which 
vowels count for nothing and consonants for very little ', and Max Muller's 
well-known epigram that, ' a sound etymology has nothing to do with 
sound '. The fundamental difference between Yaska and Plato is that the 
former distinguished roots from affixes and suffixes, i. e. the radical from 
the formative element, and hence was able to formulate general principles 
for analysing words into their constituent parts ; the latter did not realize 
this distinction and consequently made conjecture the basis of etymology. 
It may be remarked, however, that Sanskrit is generally acknowledged to 
be more perspicuous than Greek ; it was easier therefore to see this dis- 
tinction in Sanskrit than it was in Greek, and besides Yaska had the 
advantage of inheriting this knowledge from a long line of predecessors 
who had made this discovery at a very early period. But Yaska's 
greatness, even if every one of his etymological explanations is proved 
to be wrong — as many are manifestly so, — lies in the fact that he is the 
first to claim a scientific foundation, and also the first to formulate general 
principles for etymology. 

6. Philological s2Jeculations of Yaska. 

In two aphoristic rules, Yaska enunciates his view as to why articulate 
speech is given preference to other modes of expression, such as gestures, 
movements of hands and body, &c. He says, ' words are used to designate 
objects with regard to everyday affairs in the world, on account of their 
comprehensiveness and minuteness '.^ Durga, the commentator of Yaska, 
explains tlie term 'comprehensiveness', with regard to the psychological 
process involved in the apprehension of meaning through the instrumentality 
of the spoken word. He says that there are two phases of consciousness 
in the human mind, i.e. (1) the manifest, and (2) the unmanifest. When a 
person desires to express the manifest consciousness, his eftbrt results in the 
exhalation of breath which modified in the various speech-organs produces 
the word. The word again pervades the unmanifest consciousness of the 
hearer, makes it manifest, and thus the meaning is apprehended.'^ Using 
philological terminology, we may express the same thing by saying that 
tliere are permanent word-records in the sub-conscious strata of the human 

' Jowott, Dialogues of Plato (3rd ed.), vol. i, ^ TJie Nirukta, i. 2. 

p. 33.5. 3 Diirga on N. i. 2. 



ETYMOLOGY, PHILOLOGY, AND SEMANTICS 65 

mind. These word-records are brought from tlie sub-conscious to tlie 
conscious state by articuLated speech. It may Vje objected that what- 
ever the psychological process may be, the most important use of the word 
is to express and convey the meaning to somebody else, and this purpose can 
equally be accomplished by other methods, such us gestures, movements of 
hands, face, and eyes. As if Yaska had anticipated this objection, he adds 
the term 'minuteness' in his aphorism. Durga has the following comment: 
The movements of hands and the winking of the eyes, &c., are also com- 
prehensive, they will express the meaning and in tliis manner we will be 
saved the trouble of studying grammar and the bulky Vedic literature. 
True, gestures, &c., are comprehensive, but they are not minute, i. e. they 
involve greater effort in production and are always indefinite. Even 
discarding Durga's elaborate explanation of ' comprehensiveness ', Yaska's 
aphorism can mean only that words are used in the everyday affairs of 
the world because they are capable of giving expression to every kind of 
meaning with their numerous shades of difference, and are produced with 
comparatively less exertion. There seems to be no doubt that at the time 
of writing the above-mentioned aphorism, Yaska had in his mind the 
alternative method of expression by means of gestures, &c. And his argu- 
ment that words are preferred to gestures, on account of the economy of 
effort, has a strikingly modern note. 

7. Origin of Language. 

Yaska is a follower of the scliool of etymologists, whose fundamental 
doctrines is that all words are derived from original roots. ^ Gargya and 
the followers of the school of grammarians do not agree with him.^ There 
is also a short discussion about onomatopoeia.^ Aupamanyava maintains 
that there is no such thing as onomatopoeia, but Yaska holds that there are 
some words which are formed by the mere imitation of sounds of nature, 
mostly the names of birds, such as crow, partridge, &c., but which can be 
derived otherwise also. It is surprising that in this connexion he does not 
mention the word cuckoo. Besides the names of birds, he thinks that the 
following words are similarly formed. Kitava ^, ' a gambler ' ; dundubhi ^ 
'a drum'; ciscd krnotl^, 'it makes a ciscd sound'; Jirka', the former 
part of hvkavdhii, 'a cock'. According to Yaska, onomatopoeia does not 
play any important part in the foundation of language. He discards

66 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

therefore the so-called Bow-wow theory.^ As Yaska reduces all words to 
primordial roots, he may therefore be regarded as an adherent of the 
root-theory. 

This again affords a point of difference from the Gratylus, where Plato, 
in attempting to trace the origin of the sounds of the alphabet to the 
sounds of nature, considers onomatopoeia to be the most important factor 
in the formation of language. As an objection to his theory, it may be 
remarked that the objects with which men in primitive society are most 
familiar would be things like ' cave ', ' pit ', ' tree ', &c., and the naming 
of these objects precludes all imitation of natural sounds. Words like 
' digger ', ' weaver ', &c., would represent a higher stage of civilization. ^ 

8. Parts of Speech. 

Yaska says that there are four parts of speech : noun and verb, 
preposition and particle." At first sight, it seems inexplicable that an 
ancient author like Yaska should mention preposition as a part of speech 
and should ignore adverbs which historically can be shown to have been 
evolved at an earlier stage of the linguistic development than the former. 
The difficulty, however, disappears when it is remembered that prepositions 
in Sanskrit are seldom used to express case relations, but mostly serve as 
adverbial prepositions. With Yaska's division of speech into four parts 
may be compared the remarks of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who 
attributes a similar classification to Aristotle. 

' Composition is .... a certain arrangement of the parts of speech, 
. . . These were reckoned as three only by Theodectes and Aristotle and 
the philosophers of those times, who regarded nouns, verbs, and connectives 
as the primary parts of speech. Their successors, particularly the leaders 
of the Stoic school, raised the number to four, separating the article from 
the connectives.' "• According to Aristotle, ' Diction viewed as a whole is 
made up of the following parts : the letter (or the ultimate element), the 
syllable, the conjunction, the article, the noun, the verb, the case, and the 
speech.' ^ 

9. Aridotle's definition of Noun and Verb. 

Yaska defines the noun and the verb as follows : ' A verb has 
heooming as its fundamental notion, a noun has being as its funda- 
mental notion. But where both (i.e. becoming and being) are dominated 
by becoming as in a verbal noun), a becoming arising from a former

' Nirukta, i. 1. 



ETYMOLOGY, PHILOLOGY. AND SEMANTICS 67 

to a later state is denoted by a verb, as ' he o-oes ', ' he cooks ', &c. ; while 
the embodiment of the whole process beginning with the original and 
ending with the final conception, which has assumed the character of 
being, is denoted bj^ a noun, as ' going ', ' cooking ', &c} Further, becoming 
has six modifications: (1) genesis, (2) existence, (3) alteration, (4) growth, 
(5) decay, and (6) destruction.^ With these may be compared Aristotle's 
definitions of noun and verb. ' A noun or name is a composite signi- 
ficant sound not involving the idea of time, with parts which have no 
significance by themselves in it. ... A verb is a composite significant 
sound involving the idea of time, with parts which have no significance by 
themselves in it. Whereas the word ' man ' or ' white ' does not imply 
when, ' walks ' and ' has walked ' involve in addition to the idea of walking 
that of time present or time past.' ^ 

In his definition of a verb, Aristotle lays great emphasis on the idea 
of time, but ignores the idea of action involved in it ; his definition is 
therefore incomplete and states the element of lesser importance only, for 
of the two ideas of action, and time, the former is of primary and the 
latter of secondary significance. Yaska has hit on the right word, i. e. 
becoming which expresses both, the notion of action and time as well. 
Aristotle's definition of a noun is a negative one. He explains what it 
does not involve, but not what it positively does involve. Yaska, on the 
other hand, gives a positive definition, setting forth being to be the 
fundamental notion of a noun. Further, he also defines a verbal noun, 
which is ignored by Aristotle. 

Yaska explains prepositions as words which bring into prominence the 
subordinate meaning of nouns and verbs. He then subjoins a list of 
twenty prepositions assigning to each its appropriate meaning. Proceeding 
further, he divides particles into three groups, (1) comparatives, (2) con- 
junctives, and (3) expletives. He defines these terms, giving a list of the 
particles of each group, explaining their meanings and illustrating their 
uses by suitable quotations from Vedic literature. They are treated in 
detail in the first chapter of the Xiru/cta (sec. 3-9). 

Yaska observes the dialectical differences in the spoken language of 
his time. Thus he points out certain characteristics of the speech of the 
Aryans and the Kambojas, the people of the East, and the people of the 
North.^ He acknowledgfes the relation of the classical to the Vedic 
Sanskrit. Thus he remarks that their vocabulary is identical,^ that their 
use of prepositions and particles with occasional exceptions is similar.*'

68 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

He seems to be conscious of the historical connexion of the two languages 
when he says that the words of the one are derived from the roots of the 
other.^ He knows that it is not nouns only, but also verbs, which have 
synonyms. ' So many verbs have the same meaning. So many are the 
synonym of a noun (lit. being).' - He explains homonym as a word which 
has more than one meaning.^ He also notices certain idiomatic expressions, 
whose order is immutably fixed as ' Indra and Agni ', ' father and son ', but 
not ' Agni and Indra ', ' son and father '.* 

Semantics. 

Hoiu names are given. 

The epoch of Yaska was an age of remarkable literary activity. There 
seems to be a general striving after the search of truth in all the depart- 
ments of human knowledge. On the philosophic side, it marks the 
beginning of the Upanisadic period which preached monotheism of an 
exalted type, and gave expression to some of the sublimest thoughts ever 
recorded in the history of mankind. On the religious side, it was the 
harbinger of the Buddha who was soon to carry out a campaign of 
vigorous protestantism against the then prevailing ritualistic practices. 
Even in the matter of style, it is the period of transition which ushered in 
the era of the aphorism (sutra). As shown above, the age was busy with 
grammatical and philological speculations, nor was semantics ignored. In 
the first chapter of the Niriihta (see 1.2-14), Yaska discusses the question, 
how names are given. The most important arguments are set forth in the 
form of questions and answers. A critic is introduced who raises the 
various points of objection, each of which is duly answered by the author. 
It is a dialogue consisting of two monologues which are put in the mouths 
of the critic and the author in succession. The arguments are as follows : 
(i) Every being who performs a particular action should be called by the 
same name, e. g. every one who runs on the road should be called asva 
(runner), and not the horse alone ; everything that pricks, as a needle 
or spear for instance, should be called trna (pricker) and not a blade of 
grass alone. (2) Every being should be given as many names as the 
actions with which that particular being is associated, e. g. a pillar should be 
called not slliund (i.e. which stands upright) only, but also dara kiyd 
(i.e. which rests in a hole), and also safijanl (i.e. which is joined with the 
beams). (3) Only such words should be used in giving names as are 
regularly derived from roots according to the rules of grammar, so that 

1 Nirukta, ii. 2. 2 q^,_ cit. i. 20. ^ op. dt. iv. 1. * Op. cil. i. 10. 



ETYMOLOGY, PHILOLOGY, AND SEMANTICS 69 

the meaning of the object which they denote, should be quite clear and free 
from doubt, e.g.jntrusa (man) should be puri-iaya (i.e. city-dweller); 
aiva (horse) = asta (i. e. runner) ; trnu (grass) = tardana (pricker) and so 
on. (4) If the name of an object is to be determined by its actions, the 
being precedes the action (e.g. the horse comes into existence before it 
actually runs), the designation of a being, which is earlier, from an action, 
which is subsequent to it, is not tenable (perhaps for the reason that it 
will leave the being nameless during the interval). (5) People indulge in 
sophistry in explaining names, as for instance, when it is said that earth 
(prthivi) is so called on account of its being broad (prafh), they do not 
consider as to who made it broad and on what basis. 



Rejoinder. 

(1) We find that of the beings who perform a particular action, all do 
not get the same name but only a few, e. g. every one who cuts wood is not 
called taksaka, but the carpenter alone is so called ; it is the ascetic only 
who is called pari-vrdjaka (i. e. a wanderer) and not every one who 
wanders ; it is only the sap of the sugar-cane that is called jlvana (i. e. 
enlivening) and not everything that enlivens; it is only the planet Mars 
that is called hhumi-ja (i. e. earth-born), and not everything that is born 
from the earth and so on. He seems to imply that there is a law of 
specialization by which a particular name comes to be exclusively associated 
with a particular object. 

(2) He means to say that in spite of their manifold activities, objects 
take their name from one particular action, which is the most important 
and the most special to them, e. g. a carpenter performs many actions, yet 
he is called taksaka (i. e. a cutter of wood), because the shaping of things 
by cutting wood is his most important function and can be specially 
associated with him. Durga has the following comment on it : 

Wf^ ti^rf^ ^^HPrf^ xj^T^T . . . rf^ ^!f^TT%(g'^% I ^SRI^f^^fx? ^ 



70 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

' Thou seest, my friend, and we also see, that one man who cuts wood 
is called ' carpenter ', while another who does the same is not so called. 
You may well ask the reason. Listen ; go and ask the world, quarrel with 
the world if you like, for it is not I who made this law. But this is what 
we find : of those who do the same work, some are named in accordance 
with that activity, others not. You may say that because one object is 
named in accordance with that activity, therefore others doing the same 
thing should be similarly named . . . Although all nouns are derived 
from verbs, the choice of names with reference to a particular action 
is made by nature (svabkdvatah) ; or it may be that the choice is 
made by the law of special action. A man who performs one particular 
action more specially, whatever other actions he may perform, will 
obtain his name from that particular action. This is a settled rule. For 
we do not call the man, who cuts wood now and then, by the name of 
carpenter, but him we call carpenter who cuts wood at any time, or in any 
place and always. This is an instance of a name, the choice of which is 
made by special action and this name may be freely given ^to others who 
perform the same action specially. And if sometimes, or somewhere, 
some other action is still more special to them, they will obtain their 
names in accordance with that action only. . . . 

We see that persons who perform many actions, obtain their names 
from one particular action. A carpenter performs many other actions, 
but he is not called after those activities. ... If it be said, that many 
persons who perform the same action, should have a common name, and 
one person who performs many actions, should have as many names, all 
that we can say is, that it is contrary to the practice of the world. Neither 
is the case. Whether many persons perform a particular action, or a single 
person many actions, the law about the names is that the choice is made 
by natural selection.' ^ 

With this may be compared the remarks of Br^al. 

' One conclusion is to be drawn from all that has gone before : it is an 
undoubted fact that Language designates things in an incomplete and 

' Cf. Max Miiller's traiiislatioii of some parts of the above-quoted passage {ibid., p. 167). 



ETYMOLOGY, PHILOLOGY, AND SEMANTICS 71 

inaccurate manner. Incomplete : since we have not exhausted all that can 
be said of the sun when we have declared it to be shining, or of the horse 
when we say that it trots. Inaccurate : since we cannot say of the sun 
that it shines when it has set, or of the horse that it trots when it is at 
rest, or when wounded or dead. 

Substantives are signs attached to things : they contain exactly that 
amount of truth which can be contained by a name, an amount which is of 
necessity small in proportion to the reality of the object. ... It will be 
impossible for language to introduce into the word all the ideas which this 
entity or object awakens in the mind. Language is therefore compelled to 
choose.' ^ 

(3) Many words whose grammatical form is quite regular are used to 
denote names of objects, such as vratati (creeper), jdgaruka. (wakeful), 
dai^i-homl (one who sacrifices with a ladle), &c. 

(4) We find that many objects get names which are based on subsequent 
actions, e. g. the wood-pecker. 

(5) If prthivl (earth) is derived from \/ praih (to be broad) there is no 
sophistry at all. It is not necessary to consider as to who made it broad 
and on what basis, for it is broad to the eye. 

Thus the question is discussed in the Nirulda. The same question is 
discussed at length in the Cratylus also, wherein Plato propounds three 
theories and makes the three characters in the dialogue their exponents. 
Hermogenes holds that names are conventional, arbitrarily given, and 
altered at will. Its antithesis is represented by Cratylus who maintains 
that they are natural. Socrates takes an intermediate position and 
admits that names are natural and at the same time have an element 
of convention as well.^ 

i. Early anti-Vedie Scepticism. 

In the fifteenth section of the first chapter of the Nirukta, a critic 
is introduced in the person of Kautsa, who not only questions the authority 
of the Vedas, but actually maintains that the Vedic stanzas are meaningless, 
adducing several arguments in support of his assertion. From the twentieth 
section of the same chapter it is evident that Yaska believes the Vedic 
hymns to be revealed, having been handed down from generation to 
generation by oral tradition, and requiring to be studied with great care ; 
the purpose of his own work being to facilitate this study. As the

pp. 171, 172. pp. 327-8, 358, 366, 878. 



72 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

Nirukta is one of the six auxiliary treatises of the Veda, it is rather 
difficult to say with what object Yaska presented and tried to controvert 
the view of his opponents, for it is inconceivable that the learned theologians 
would reproduce, in their orthodox books, a controversy which challenges 
the most fundamental beliefs of their religion. The reproduction of the 
Kautsa controversy indicates on the one hand, that not only Yaska was 
endowed with a rationalistic spirit, and was free from bigoted fanaticism, 
but also that it was possible to carry on such discussions with tolerance at 
that period of remote antiquity ; and implies on the other, that Kautsa was 
an eminent scholar, or some great personality, or the exponent of some 
philosophic system, whose thought could not be ignored. Some, however, 
think that Yaska has invented Kautsa as a convenient method of giving 
expression to Vedic Scepticism. This view is conjectural, and is not sup- 
ported by any evidence. Yaska uses the terms eke, and ekam, aparam, &c. 
when he wants to refer to something in general, and he could have very 
well employed the same terms with regard to the above-mentioned con- 
troversy, had it not been associated with a particular individual, i. e. 
Kautsa. There is no ground to doubt the historical existence of the 
authorities whose opinions are quoted, or referred to, or to whom particular 
statements are attributed, by Yaska. And unless the contrary can be 
proved, it may be assumed that Kautsa was an historical entity. It 
ma}^ also be taken for granted that he was the leader of a movement, 
which may be described as something akin to materialistic rationalism, 
and which was the result of a remarkable literary activity, a characteristic 
of the epoch of Yaska, as pointed out elsewhere. But Kautsa was by no 
means the originator of such a movement, the beginning of which can be 
traced to an earlier period. Its origin is probably to be sought in 
sectarianism. For a considerable time, the Atharva-veda was not recognized 
as divine revelation. For the followers of the Atharva-veda, it was there- 
fore necessary to demonstrate the superiority of their own Veda to the 
RV., the SV., and the VS. Perhaps the most effective means, employed for 
the achievement of this object, was to invent legends and allegorical 
stories, in which all the four Vedas are introduced, and in which a certain 
task is proposed for them. The RV., the SV., and the VS. are invariably 
shown to be incompetent in its performance, and it is given up as too 
difficult by the three Vedas in succession, being finally accomplished by 
the AV., whose superiority over the other three Vedas is thus implicitly 
expressed. I quote the following two stories from the Gopatha Brahmana 
in support of my statement : 



EARLY ANTI-VEDIC SCEPTICISM 73 

' Speech said to them, " tame the horse ". " Be it so ", replied they. 
Having approached him, the RV. said, " I shall tame the horse ". When 
he set about (accomplishing it), a great terror seized him. He turned her 
in the eastern direction. He declared, " this horse is wild indeed ". The 
VS. approached him and said, " I shall tame the horse ". When he set 
about (accomplishing it), a great terror seized him. He turned her in the 
western direction. He declared, "this horse is wild indeed". The vSV. 
approached him and said, " I shall tame the horse ". " How indeed wilt 
thou tame the horse ? " " Rathantaram is the name of" my song of praise 
which is neither terrific, nor harsh. With that the horse is praised ". But 
when he set about (accomplishing it), the same great terror seized him. 
He turned her in the northern direction. He declared, '• the horse is indeed 
still wild ".'1 

After these futile attempts, they are advised to seek Atkarvana the 
tamer. They approach him and request him to tame the horse. He 
prepares the water of tranquillity, which he sprinkles over the horse. 
From ever}^ limb of the horse flames fall down on the ground, and the 
horse, perfectly tame, salutes the sage. 

The object of the following story is to show the incompetency of 
the three Vedas to atFord protection :

greatest shelter, with which thou canst best protect us '. He assumed the

form of the RV., and having approached, stood before them. The gods 
said to him, " assume some other form ; with this form thou canst not 
aflPord us the greatest shelter, with this form thou canst not best pro- 
tect us". He assumed the form of the VS., and having approached 
stood behind them. The gods said to him, " assume some other form ; 
with this form thou canst not afford us the greatest shelter, with this 
form thou canst not best protect us ". He assumed the form of the SV., 
and. having approached stood to their north. The gods said to him, 
" assume some other form ; with this form thou canst not afford us the 
greatest shelter, with this form thou canst not best protect us ".' -^ 

Indra then assumes the form of the Brahma-veda, i. e. the Atharva-veda, 
which is approved by the gods as competent to give them the greatest 
protection. 

It need hardly be said that the efforts of the followers of the Atharva- 
veda were crowned with success, for, in course of time, the AV. was 
recognized as one of the revealed scriptures. But their method of dis- 
crediting the other Vedas gave rise to a movement of inquiry and 
scepticism — a movement, the traces of which can still be discovered in 
isolated passages of the Aranyahas and the U'panisads. Besides the fact 
that the anti-Vedic ideas have been preserved in the Aratiyakas and the 
Upanisads, which, according to the orthodox tradition, are a part of the 
scriptures, indicates that the movement must have been important and 
wide-spread, so much so that even some of the Vedic Scholars came under 
its influence, and freely gave expression to their heterodox views, some 
of which have survived. I quote the following passages in support of the 
foregoing conclusion : 

' Verily it was so, then the Kavaseyas, the learned seers, said, " to what 
purpose shall we study the Vedas, to what purpose shall we sacrifice 1 
We sacrifice breath in speech, and speech in breath ; whosoever is born is 
indeed the authoritative person." ' ^ 

' People say, " Hynm, Hynm ". Tliis earth indeed, is the hymn, for all, 
whatever exists springs from it.' "^ 

The study of the Vedas is regarded as avidyd (non-knowledge) in MU. 

' GB. i. 2. 19 ; Bib. Ind. ed., p. 36. « A. A. iii. 2. 6 ; Keith's ed., p. 139.

EARLY ANTI-VEDIC SCEPTICISM 75 

I. 1. 4-5 ; as lower knowledge in MU. III. 2. 3 ; KU. I. 2. 23. The full 
force of this condemnation will be realized, if it is borne in mind that the 
Upanimds are also regarded as revealed books (iruti). The case would 
be analogous if, for instance, St. Paul had declared in one of his epistles 
that the study of the Bible is non-knowledge, or lower knowledge. The 
following are the other anti-Vedic passages : Brh. U., I. 5, 23 ; Kau. U., 

II. 5; Ch. Z7.,V. 11-24; TU., 11. o; Vivekacuddmani 2; the Jain Uttard- 
dhydyana sutras, IV. 12 ; XIV. 12 ; Gitd, 11, 42, 45 ; IX. 21 : XI. 48, 53. 
In order to reconcile them with the pro-Vedic doctrines, the commentators 
have offered ingenious explanations of these passages. 

It is possible that the Buddha came under the influence of this anti- 
Vedic movement at an early period, which may be responsible for his 
vehement denunciation not only of Vedic rites and practices, injunctions, 
and invocations, &c., but of Vedic lore. He held them up to ridicule, and 
discarded them as an obstacle to final emancipation. His views about 
Vedic knowledge have been preserved in the form of a dialogue in the 
Tevijja sutta in the Dlgha Nikdya. Two Brahmanas, Yasettha and 
Bharadvaja quarrel as to which is the true path. Unable to settle their 
dispute, they go to the Buddha for a decision. The Buddha holds a 
conversation with them, and after perplexing and confounding them with 
analogies and arguments in a Socratic manner, gradually leads them to his 
own way of thinking, and finally converts them to Buddhism. The im- 
portant parts of the dialogue with regard to the Vedas are the following : 

13. ' Well then, Vasettha, those ancient Rsis of the Brahmanas versed 
in the three Vedas, the authors of the verses ... to wit, . . . Vamadeva, 
Vessamitta, Jamadaggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and 
BhagU' — did even they speak thus, saying : " We know it, we have seen it, 
where Brahma is, whence Brahma is, whither Brahma is ? " 

" Not so, Gautama ! " 

15. ... "Just, Vasettha, as when a string of blind men are clinging to 
one another, neither can the foremost see, nor can the middle one see, 
nor can the hindmost see — just even so, methinks, Vasettha, is the talk 
of the Brahmanas versed in the three Vedas but blind talk . . . the 
talk ... of the Brahmanas versed in the three Vedas turns out to be 
ridiculous, mere words, a vain and empty thing." 

24. "Again, Vasettha, if this river Aciravati were full of water even to 
the brim, and overflowing, and a man with business on the other aide, 
bound for the other side, should come up, and want to cross over, and he, 
standing on this bank, should invoke the farther bank, and say, ' Come 
hither, O Farther Bank ! Come over to this side ! ' " 

"Now what think you, Vasettha? Would the farther bank of the 



76 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

river Aciravati, by reason of that man's invoking and praying and hoping 
and praising, come over to this side ? " 

" Certainly not, Gautama ! " 

25. " In just the same way, Vasettha, do the Brahmanas versed in the 
three Vedas . . . say thus : ' Indra we call upon, Soma we call upon, 
Varuna we call upon, Isana we call upon, Pajapati we call upon, Brahma 
we call upon . . .' Yerilj-, Vasettha, . . that they, by reason of their invoking 
and praying and hoping and praising, should after death . . . become 
united with Brahma — verily such a condition of things can in no wise be." 

35. "... Therefore is it that the threefold wisdom of the Brahmanas, 
wise in their three Vedas, is called a waterless desert, their threefold 
wisdom is called a pathless jungle, their threefold wisdom is called 
perdition. " ' ^ 

In criticism of this, it may be remarked that the views of the Buddha 
concerning Vedic prayer are erroneous. His arguments, and especially 
his analogy of the bank of the Aciravati, are applicable to any other 
prayer as well, and thus prayer itself will become an absurdity. Not only 
is prayer a very important act of worship in every religion, but in the 
form of the wheel of prayer is the most distinguishing characteristic of 
Tibetan Buddhism. Moreover, prayer is a psychical phenomenon, it exerts 
a powerful influence on the mind through the medium of subconscious 
suggestion, and as such its efficacy is beyond doubt. Further, the analogy 
of the Buddha is fallacious. To compare not only sentient but omniscient 
and omnipotent God with an inanimate piece of matter like the bank of 
a river, and then to deduce a conclusion from this comparison that because 
the latter does not respond to prayer hence the former also does not do so, 
is altogether unjustifiable. Nevertheless the Buddha's denunciation of the 
Vedas developed a strong contempt for them in his followers who often 
trampled them under foot.^ It is also probable that these teachings of the 
Buddha inspired other non- Vedic schools as well. The criticisms of some 
of these schools are equally vehement, and one seems to hear the rever- 
berated echo of the voice of the Buddha even in some of their expressions. 
The following passage gives the views of the Carvaka system : 

' The Dialogues of the Buddha, translated into English hy Rhys-Davids, S.B.B., vol. ii, 
pp. 304-14: cf. also S.B.E., vol. xi, pp. 159-203.

' If you object ..." how should men of experienced wisdom engage in 
the Agnihotra and other sacrifices ", . . . your objection cannot be accepted 
as any proof to the contrary, since the Agnihotra, &c. are only useful as 
means of livelihood, for the Veda is tainted by the three faults of untruth, 
self-contradiction, and tautology ; then again the impostors who call them- 
selves Vedic Pandits are mutually destructive, as the authority of the 
Jfianakanda is overthrown by those who maintain that of the Karma- 
kanda, and vice versa ; and lastly, the three Vedas themselves are only 
the incoherent rhapsodies of knaves, and to this effect runs the popular 
saying: Brihaspati says that the (performance of) Agnihotra, the three 
Vedas, the three staves, and smearing oneself with ashes, are but means 
of livelihood for those who have neither sense, nor manliness.' ^ 

' If a beast, slain in the jyotisto'tna sacrifice goes to heaven, why then, 
does not the sacrificer kill his own father ? ' ^ 

' The three authors of the Veda were buftbons, knaves, and spirits of 
darkness. Jarpharl, turphari, &c., these are the well-known rhapsodies 
of the Pandits.' ^ 

The Arhata system has the following criticism with regard to the 
Vedas : 

irf^T!T ^^^ ^ cfi^ -Rfciirr^ ii 

'And a non-eternal omniscient being cannot be the subject of an eternal 
Veda ; then how can he be expounded by a spurious and a false Veda ? ' * 

Cf. also : ' There was neither the Sama-veda, nor the Yajur-veda, nor 
the Rg-veda, nor was any work done by man.' ^ 

The earlier anti-Vedic scepticism, together with the doctrines of the 
Buddhist, the Carvaka, and the Arhata systems must have created, in

78 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

course of time, a considerable amount of opposition to the teachings of the 
Vedas. It was therefore necessary for the followers of the Vedas to 
answer the objections of their opponents and to re-establish their position. 
Hence Jaimini was compelled to devote almost the whole of the first 
adhydya of the Purva-Mwndmsd, to the examination and refutation of 
such objections. The substance of Kautsa's criticism, together with the 
subject-matter of Yaska's rejoinder is amplified with numerous additions 
in the first chapter of the PM. The controversy, however, is too long to 
be quoted here. Kumarila Bhatta, the commentator on the PM. was 
another expounder of Vedic doctrines, and after him the task devolved 
on the great Sankaracarya, who by his eloquence, vast learning, profound 
philosophy, and great powers of debate rebuilt the shattered supremacy of 
the Vedic religion, and extirpated Buddhism ^ and other non-Vedic systems 
from the land of their birth. But adverse critics of the Veda, even after 
the great Sankaracarya, have not been altogether unknown in India. For 
instance, Nanaka, the founder of the Sikh religion, may be mentioned 
as a notable teacher who laid great emphasis on saintliness, and discarded 
the Vedas as mere mythical records. He said : 

Santa M mahimd veda na jane 

Gallon veda kalidni. 

' The greatness of a saint is not known to the Veda ; all the four Vedas 
are merely (books of) stories.' 
Hence we find that Sayanacarya again reverts to the same discussion 
in the introduction of his commentary on the Rg-veda. The number of 
arguments for and against is still further increased. A brief summary 
of the controversy is subjoined : 

Criticism. 

' The 2)rimd facie view is that there is no such thing as the Veda ; how 
can there be a part of it, as the Rg-veda ? .... It is not possible to admit 
the existence of the Veda, for it is not capable of definition or proof.' ^ 

( 1 ) If the Veda is defined as being the last of three kinds of proofs, 
perception, inference, and evidence, the definition will be too wide, for 
it will include the Smrtis as well. 

(2) If the Veda is defined as an instrument of apprehending trans- 
cendental things, the definition will again suft'er from the same defect. 

' However, the final blow was dealt by the commentary of Sayanacarya,vol.i, pp. 2-3.

EARLY ANTI-VEDIC SCEPTICISM 79 

(3) The qualifying expres.sion, 'being not the product of liuman 
authors ', will not improve the definition, for the Vedas are the works of 
human authors, though they may be super-men. 

(4) If you say that by ' human authors ' you mean ' men having a 
corporeal frame ', we will draw your attention to the lywrum-b^lkta. 

(5) If you say that by ' corporeal frame ' you mean ' a body which is 
the result of the actions of a previous life ', we will point out that Agni, 
Vayu, and Aditya, the authors of the Vedas, were endowed with bodies 
which were the result of actions of a previous life. 

(6) If the Veda is defined as a collection of words (iabda-rdiih) con- 
sisting of the "mantra and the Brdhmaiia, it does not hold good, for up till 
now it has not been settled what is mantra, and what is Brdliniana. 

(7) Nor is there any proof of the existence of the Veda. The scriptural 
quotations in support of j^our contention are useless, as they are cited from 
the Vedas themselves, and nothing can be proved by its own evidence. 
No man, however clever, can mount his own shoulders. 

(8) If you say that the consensus of public opinion is in favour of the 
Vedas, we will reply that the whole world can be deluded ; for instance, 
the people believe in a blue sky, yet there is no such thing as sky, nor has 
its blue colour any reality. 

Sdyana's rejoinder. 

(1) The definition of the Veda as a collection of words, consisting of the 
mantra and the Brdhmana is faultless ; therefore Apastamba has said, 
' The Veda is the name given to the mantra and the Brdhmaiw..' 

(2) It is true that things like a jar, or a piece of cloth, &c., are not 
self-luminous, but it does not follow from this that the sun, and the stars, 
&c., too have no such character. Granting that it is impossible for a man 
to mount his own shoulders, nevertheless, the Vedas have the power to 
illuminate themselves as well as other things. 

(3) You have to recognize the various kinds of proofs, including 
evidence. And the evidence of the Smrtis, and of tradition cannot but be 
admitted as proof of the existence of the Veda. Hence, the Vedas cannot 
be overthrown by any of the infidels like the followers of Carvaka. 

Further criticism. 

(1) Admitting that there exists a thing called the Veda, it is not worth 
a commentary, for the Veda is of no authority (na hi Vedah pramdiiam). 

(2) Some define authority as ' an instrument of sound experience ', 
others as ' a means of acquiring knowledge, not known before '. Neither 
of these is to be found in the Veda. 



80 INTRODUCTION TO THE NIRUKTA 

Then follows an amplified statement of Kautsa's criticism. Sayana's 
reply gives the substance of Yaska's rejoinder with additions and modifica- 
tions, to which is added a long quotation from the first chapter of the 
imrca-Mlmdmsd, reference to which has already been made. 

It would be superfluous to collect the pro-Vedic passages. The Vedas 
are the foundation of the whole of Sanskrit literature. But the triumph of 
the Vedic school is apparent from this fact alone that all the anti-Vedic 
systems have either perished, or been driven into exile, or been reduced to 
insignificance. Thus the pre-Buddhistic anti-Vedic scepticism can now be 
traced in a few isolated passages only. Buddhism, once the state religion 
of the Mauryan Empire at its zenith under A^oka, — the then greatest 
Empire in the world — has been banished from its native land. The 
Carvaka and the Arhata systems have been reduced to insignificance. 
Their followers are few and far between, and their influence on Indian 
thought and religion is so small that for all practical purposes it can be 
safely ignored.
