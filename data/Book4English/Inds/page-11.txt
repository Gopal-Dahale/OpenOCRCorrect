a. Detailed Description of the Manuscripts.

M 1.-This is a neatly-written manuseript in Devanagari characters on

to the longer recension. The seribe seems to have been a devotee of Krsna,

of the ink.

It begins: ऊँ नमो गणेशाय ॥ ऊँ ॥ अथ शिक्षां प्रवच्यामि . . . , &e. It gives
॥5९ Catustaya in 26 leaves. 'The different treatises are not bodily
